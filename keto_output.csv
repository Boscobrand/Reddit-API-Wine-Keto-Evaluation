Re: Opposition to Tariffs on Imported Wine from the European Union

 

Dear Amb. Lighthizer:

 

I am writing as a customer and consumer of imported and domestic wines that is concerned with the multiple rounds of tariffs that are being imposed and considered on wine from the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù). I strongly urge you not to punish me, or my fellow wine lovers, or hardworking wine retailers, for problems we didn‚Äôt cause. It‚Äôs unfair at face value. You should punish those responsible. Punishing Airbus and their suppliers and French digital services companies would be much more effective, as well as fair.

Beginning on October 18, 2019, the U.S. Government imposed a 25-percent tariff on certain French wine as part of retaliatory tariffs against the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù) after the World Trade Organization authorized retaliation for the EU‚Äôs failure to comply with WTO rulings on subsidies provided to Airbus. All the while Airbus itself was only issued a 10% tariff. I understand that a 100-percent tariff is proposed on French sparkling wine (consisting mostly of champagne) and that this tariff is part of the Section 301 duties imposed on imports from France as a result of the country‚Äôs Digital Services Tax (‚ÄúDST‚Äù). Finally, on December 10, 2019, USTR proposed imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent on all wines from the EU.

Because of these import tariffs, the prices will go up dramatically for wine. Margins on wine are extremely small, and the sale of wine is highly regulated, with virtually every state imposing a three-tier distribution system with markups occurring at each tier of distribution. Thus, a 25-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 50-percent increase and a 100-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 150-percent increase in prices for a consumer like me.

 

There is no substitute for imports of wine from the EU. Wines from the EU are different from domestic wines and wines from other countries as a matter of consumer taste. In addition, because it takes many years to plant new grape vineyards and allow the vineyards to produce mature fruit that can be harvested to make wine, it will take at least a decade before the U.S. domestic wine industry could ever be in a position to begin replacing wine imports from the EU.

 

As a wine consumer, I do not understand why individual consumers like me and small U.S. businesses should suffer because of a dispute involving Boeing and Airbus or France‚Äôs digital services tax. Retaliatory tariffs on these matters should target Airbus and their suppliers who benefitted from the subsidies, and French digital services companies.

Welcome to the first tasting notes post for 2020!  It sounds like this might prove to be a popular change to the MWC based on the selection post, and I hope that it is echoed in this thread!  I hope everyone has had a chance to find their selections.  I had to order mine in (NZ pinot is not very easy to find here locally beyond Kim Crawford.  But I was able to find a couple, and I hope you did too.  If not, no worry, just post what you were ablle to find!   As a reminder, this  months selection is:

**Grape:** Pinot Noir  
**Country and Region #1:** USA, Pacific North West  
**Country and Region #2:** New Zealand, Any

That's right!  Two wines this month!  And as a reminder, if you can only find wine from one region and not the other, thats quite alright.  Just post what you can.  Remember, in your notes, be sure to include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle  and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, the  country/region, the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall  recommendation (whether beautiful or terrible, food pairings, etc.).

Need help with your notes?   [Wine Folly has a great article!](http://winefolly.com/review/write-excellent-wine-tasting-notes/)

I look forward to reading your notes!  And as always, I am open to suggestions for future challenges, including for the Experimental Series!"

26,euu194,Any tips on getting out of a wine club...?,wine,"Also posted in /r/legaladvice, but I suspect you guys will have some interesting answers. :) 

I recently moved and joined a wine club through a local shop: every quarter there's a club event with food/drinks and you pick out your wine from multiple local wineries. If you do not attend the event, you get assigned wine from whatever is left over and you pick it up/it's shipped.

My job has unexpectedly involved a lot of travel lately, and I would like to bow out of the club*. I responded to their most recent email - an invitation to the next member event - letting them know I can't attend due to work, and in light of my new job could I please cancel my subscription and hopefully rejoin in the summer when travel will have subsided? I was told ""we can let you skip this one event, but our wine club membership is for one year."" 

If I'm stuck in this club I'll live, of course. But has anyone else successfully extricated themselves from a club...and how? 

*In the event it's important, reasons include: I've missed previous wine club event since joining due to work-related travel for a new job and the event itself was my main reason for joining - so I could make local friends!, my fiance decided to stop drinking wine which makes a club less economical/fun...and frankly, I am not very impressed with the wines they have chosen for me."

In the past I'd tried to enjoy wine but whenever I tried it, my face scrunched up like a baby trying lemon for the first time. I was sure that I read that if that was the case I should try a sweeter wine, so I got gradually sweeter until I was at port. It was still the same problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I did a bit more research this past week and found it likely wasn't the sweetness but the acidity and tartness I was finding unbearable. So I looked in to Merlot. Definitely a marked improvement but I am not sure if it's something I just need to get used to or whether there are practical options for a lower acid red wine type.

&amp;#x200B;

I never really drank wine prior to 3 years ago when I got handed the keys to wine purchasing, read a book or two, and spent the last three years drinking too much wine, and having it capture my imagination. This is pretty much a dream come true trip, and I'm probably going to choke up a bit when I get out there. Haven't took a vacay in years, and just never expected something like this would happen.

I wanted to see if any of you good folks know what people mean when they talk about not 'shocking' red wine when bringing it to room temperature, after an already opened bottle has been stored chilled.

I've heard about this a few times and wanted to see what it's all about.  I'm imagining the idea is that there's some degradation that comes from pouring cold wine into a room temperature glass and letting it come in contact with room temperature air, but I'm wondering if this is actually true and if there's any science behind it."

Many of the wines will be oxidative wines which  i would prefer to keep for a year at least. Would that cold temperature be a problem

Utterly exceptional glass, head and shoulders above the Zalto Universal, and hands down the best beer glass I've ever used- just does incredible things to the mouthfeel.

Wasn't going to be possible to replace it (sent to NZ from mother in law in Germany) so I thought repair was worth a go.

Wasn't expecting this to work even vaguely well, it just seemed like a shitty thing ppl do for instagram likes and then toss the glass cos it's actually all wobbly and useless. Buuuuut, I have to say, as ghetto as it might look, I am pretty impressed with the 'jam it into a cork' strategy. Possibly more effective on finer/lighter glassware, than on the chunkier stuff, I suspect. This has been through the dishwasher a coupla times, and while the cork has expanded, its integrity is unchanged.

Yes, it's a bit wobbly, no I didn't get it quite straight, but that's OK! It LIVES ON.

Used a composite cork (partly as that's what was still lying on the table, partly cos I thought the resinous nature could provide better stability) but I'll def do this again next time I break summin, and try natural cork for comparison.

It's a [Mark Thomas](http://www.markthomas.at/) Double Bend Allround. Also have the Double Bend Red, which gives more fruit presence than the Zalto Burg, and his beer glass, which is amazing for barrel aged beers particularly. Keen to build a selection of the rest of the range, as my Zaltos begin to 'retire', which will give the MIL xmas and birthday gift options for many years to come

Drinking them every year or so and really experiencing how they age over the years. Since I don‚Äôt have the bank to drop on first growth or most second growth wines, I was keen on looking at some Napa cabs. I know most of the Cali cabs out there on the lower end of the price spectrum are ‚Äúready to drink‚Äù now and would maybe benefit from 5 or so years of aging but not much more. That said I was looking at Mount Veeder to buy a case or half a case to start my foray into aging...

I'm going to start going to a more local shop where I can talk directly to the owner about specific bottles, but even still, what are people's thoughts on buying wine that's more than just 2, 3, 4 years old at a big box retailer? I know Total Wine gets a bit of a bad rap, and locally in Dallas, TX we also have Goody Goody (it's at least only a north Texas chain, not a national one). But anyway, how do we know when a specific bottle was actually released? How long as that store had it? If it's a 2015 released in 2017, have they just had it for 3 years? Stored at room temperature?? I hope not... (As an aside, what's generally the most common amount of time for a winery to bottle age, i.e. time between harvest, barrel, bottle, and release). I've seen things like a 2012 Barolo going for about $40 and I just couldn't bring myself to buy it. I can't imagine that winery held onto that bottle more than 2-3 years, meaning it had potentially been outside of proper storage for 3-4 years (this was in 2019). 

My wife just bought me a bottle of **Maison Denuziere Cote Rotie Les Hauts Lieux 2015** from Total Wine for my birthday and I am ***psyched*** about it. I just can't help but be worried about how long TW may have had it, was it stored in any decent way, etc."

**Background**: Traveling as two 20 something year olds with lots of travel/food/wine experience but not a huge budget for this short trip. Of note, I'm not really into touristy vineyards but would appreciate more of an agriturismo/local/organic/artisan food type vibe + outstanding wineries who care a lot about their product (but not necessarily top international names).  Because of this, I'm apprehensive to book day trip tours on Viator etc. We're staying in Florence because we've already been and done the tourist attractions but are trying to train around Italy to fit in odds and ends.

**Where to go/tour recommendations?:** Would obviously prefer to not have to drive since we're on limited time and don't want the hassle, but would like as relaxing and pleasant/high value of an experience as we can (&lt;$200 each?). We're right now most likely going to be based in Florence, and would like some guidance on spending one full day in wine country. Not sure if people would recommend Chianti (it seems somewhat touristy but obviously more convenient), but I do have familiarity with Montepulciano and Brunello wines and enjoy them.

Also any Florence food/shop/eatery/fine goods recs would be appreciated, thanks!

To start we had a cocktail each - she had vodka with yuzu and I had a Negroni, followed by a bottle of Ruinart with Caviar, three different kinds of Oysters (from light and aromatic to rich and creamy) then squid neck. I begun choosing the red, wanting to leave it open for at least 2 hours. I originally picked a 2010 Clape Cornas but alas they were sold out. So I opted for a 2012 Luciano Sandrone Le Vigne. I have had these on release, though never with some age to them.

We then ordered two steaks, both dry aged for 36 months. One was a fillet and other rib eye on the bone, with sides. Then came the wine.

Far out what a wine - after 2 hours decanting this showed off in a big way: plums, fresh mint, orange slices, mixed herbs, fine tannin, acidity in check and long length in the every sip. Perfect with the steaks.So much feeling and joy from a top producer such as this. A 9.5/10 for me.

Finished on dessert with a glass of Kraacher, and I tipped our waiter and Somm a glass each of the red - they were happy, and so were we!

I've seen a few options floating around but I don't like any of them

1. Stand them at room temp 
2. Give up wine fridge space and make a custom shelf to hold bottles upright.
3. Wine-cradles / Don't stand 
4. Suck it up and buy an extra fridge.

Standing at room temp isn't viable here as it gets way too hot for most of the year to let the stand for that long.

Wine-fridge space is doable, but frustrating as cuts down on options I can store at home and has me fighting my offsite too much. On the plus side as long as I don't stand too much I might have room for the decanter in the fridge.

Cradles tend to cause more waste and can be fiddly especially if slow-oxing."

&amp;#x200B;

After having enjoyed a regular red burgundy from 2017 and a C√¥te de Nuits-Villages from 2012 I'd like to try either a great village wine (maybe Fixin or Vosne-Roman√©e?) or a premier cru from the C√¥te de Nuits. While it was easy to find a good quality regular red burg and a good C√¥te de Nuits-Villages, I have no idea what to look for in a high-quality village wine or a premier cru. 

Are Vivino ratings an improtant thing to look for and should I buy something online with a high rating or should I walk into my local wine store and ask them to help me pick a bottle? Are vintages very important and should I skip 2013 or isn't it that important?

I've also heard that one of the main things that distinguishes good red burgundy wines is the ability to improve over age, so should I only look for older vintages or will newer ones also be worth the money?

And one last question, in what way do young premier cru wines differ from young village ones? Is it just an improvement of the wine's balance of flavours or is there also added complexity (even though both wines are young)?

Some producers that I have access to include Drouhin, Domaine Robert Sirugue, Domaine Huguenot, Domaine Chopin, JC Boisset and Vougeraie (but I could also try find some Meo Camuzet online).

All of them had a really interesting (and consistent) insider view on Rioja wines. In their view, the classic Crianza, Reserva, Gran Reserva is great for quality control (you know how much time in oak they've spent) but it also shackles their creativity a bit. Mind you, I drank plenty of amazing ""red label"" and ‚Äúblue label‚Äù Rioja in Spain, and they've always been a treat, but when they wanted to share their ""best stuff,"" in almost every instance they reached for something with a green label, meaning it did not qualify as one of the typical classifications. They often used different oak, or less oak, or, in one case, aged it in amphora. Alternatively, they showcased some of their eccentric younger wines, ones that were complex but exhibited a much more fruit-forward experience than the typical Rioja. One winemaker summed it up like this: drinking a gran reserva is like listening to Frank Sinatra, drinking this (green label wine) is like listening to Frank Ocean. One is classic, one is new-age, both have merits.

281,eomkq0,Calling Australian wine lovers [ADVICE],wine,"What are the best wines available here at decent prices? Foreign or local. Please let‚Äôs reserve answers to actual Australians as the aim is to find wines cheap on the Australian market.

In the way of local wines, I like the Tahbilk Marsanne because it is affordable ($12) and lovely‚Äîif you decant it! It has a honeysuckle flavour that sits in a really interesting way against the minerality. It‚Äôs one-dimensional and sharp if it doesn‚Äôt have the chance to breathe before it‚Äôs drunk though! I also like the De Bortoli Cuv√©e Blanc for its relative price compared to its quality. It‚Äôs not a perfect, or even a great sparkling wine, but it‚Äôs $17 and you won‚Äôt see much that‚Äôs anything near the same quality at that price in Australia. The Stonier Pinot ($20 IIRC) is lovely as well but it‚Äôs for those who prefer the more subtle, watery type of pinot‚ÄîI like the translucent feel but for those who like stronger tastes it could seem a bit dilute. The Turkey Flat Ros√© is pretty lovely as well, it‚Äôs a cliche by now though.

I‚Äôd love to hear from others who have tried a couple of different wines and formed some sort of view. Also interested to hear about some more expensive wines (as in $40-100) because I don‚Äôt have the chance to taste them generally, but if there‚Äôs one that‚Äôs very well-regarded enough I could justify putting a bit extra towards them.

Edit: is there any person who can recommend specifically a sweet Australian sparkling wine? (As in the non-Champagne equivalent to demi-sec/semi-dry.) I don‚Äôt care about the price."

I spend pretty much all I can afford keeping up with what I already know I like, so I'm not looking for a new way to spend thousands of dollars, but I'd at least like to get a handful of bottles as a sampling to have a better idea what decent to good Burgundy (Pinot) is like. Maybe two or three bottles each of entry level, Villages, and 1er cru (maybe even one or two grand cru though not sure if I'm looking to spend that much right away) to have something to drink sooner and something to cellar for a while. But I have no idea what I'm looking for and have had a much more difficult time making sense of subregions and producers than with other regions.

I prefer 'old school'/traditional reds with less oak, ripeness, alcohol, and extraction and more structure, terroir, and elegance. Rustic/brett is totally fine. Any help figuring out which producers might be up my alley, or particular bottles to look for, would be great. Especially anything that I can actually buy right away (I've done most of my shopping through online retailers because local selection is pretty bad and prices are fairly high--I live in Tennessee)."

I‚Äôve got a lot of questions and I‚Äôd appreciate any responses you‚Äôre willing to give. Or if you want to DM that works too. 



How did you start in the wine business?


Do you import and distribute to on/off premise or import and supply distributors?


Did/does your business have a central theme or focus(other than making money) - such as a focus on Loire/Burgundy/piedmont/natural etc. 


Did you start with a group of producers from one region or several regions/countries?


What is something you wish you had known or started early in the life of the business?


What was your biggest challenge besides selling all of your products?


How prohibitive was governmental red tape?


How difficult was it to find proper shipping partners?


How long after starting was your company profitable?


Did you start with multiple employees or just yourself?



Again I appreciate your time and any responses you‚Äôre willing to share.

Hi there,   


My name is Aaron, as my thread title says I am a Senior Sommelier of 10 years, and 7 months ago became a Dad, so I moved into IT during the day to be home of an evening - though I still love wine and still wanted to be a part of it somehow. I always get asked at work for wine recommendations, and being a guest myself at different places of late I was left disappointed by the service - so I believe strongly there is room in the world for something like this.  


Way it works is simple - you message me on Whatsapp where you are eating (if outside of Australia, please provide state/country), what you mainly plan to eat, style of wine you want (bubbly, white, red? Sweet, dry, light, full?) and price range approx - then leave the rest to me! I look up the menu online, and if not available, I'll ask for a photo of the wine page that interests you.  


As this is a new idea, it is currently free to use. If you do use it, would appreciate if you share this with your friends and any feedback.   


Important to note I am from Australia, so if you are from a different timezone to me (like EU/US) then there will be a delay in me getting back to you - so thanks for waiting and I will get back asap.

Then book a seat at the window front and make sure you travel during the day (when there is light) -- the train travels directly through the Rhine valley and passes all those beautiful spots like the Loreley, a hundred castles and ALL of the vineyards on the surrounding steep hills. A great experience that never get's old and is so cheap that you have more money left for the lots of good wine you want to take home with you ;)
Hope someone will try! :)"

2013 Blanc - Surely one of the best whites to come from Bordeaux. So refreshing with this tropical lime, white flowers and fresh cream profile, fine acidity and length. Vanished quickly.   


We didn't taste these in any particular order - just poured out and tried side by side to each other.   


1998 - Creme brulee, white flowers, apricot, pineapple. Medium bodied and not rich like other vintages. Super complex. Big tick for me, my kind of Sauternes.   


2005 - Wild nose. Honey, almond, pear juice. Again, the complexity will slow you down drinking this in the best way possible. A lighter tasting style again. Very good.   


1987 - Orange, flowers, some herbal vibes - pretty straight forward. It was okay, didn't really excite me.

My good friend and ex-colleague has put time and effort into coaching me the past few months.  He's a brilliant person who has plenty of interesting things to be doing with his time, and he's chosen to dedicate hours each month to helping me.  I'd like to get him something as thank you.

He's an advanced wine connoisseur, but I am not.  Could you help me with what to get him?  Unfortunately, I don't know what he likes, but I'm going to take a conservative approach and say Old World over New World.

Also, I've been introduced to the idea of a horizontal wine tasting, and I think this would be a fun way to get him a few good wines rather than one expensive wine.

I am budgeting $100-200 for this.

What do you think?

Edit: It's perhaps also worth mentioning that I know his palate is well-trained as he has enough knowledge of others preferences and wines to know what they would like and I know he's had the good fortune of tasting a variety of great wines."

396,em0dd1,Favorite Wines in the $20-$50 Range,wine,"I know there is a cheap wine thread for anything under $20. It‚Äôs been extremely useful and has introduced me to some great values in wine. However, the $20 limit can be quite restrictive and will obviously outright exclude some regions.

I‚Äôm trying to expand my horizon and would therefore like some recommendations of your favorite wines in the $20-$50 range (USD) which you would recommend. I‚Äôm pretty open to anything so any style or varietal is welcome. I know that the Wine Bible provides some suggestions on producers for each region, so that may be a resource to look into; however, I think an open discussion of this form would be quite interesting.

Perhaps we could also expand the sidebar for $20-$50, $50-$100, $100-$250, $250-$500, to have a permanent resource, although that‚Äôs quite ambitious.

To start off (and quite commonly known):

Lopez de Heredia Tondonia is a great sub $50 wine which has beautiful structure, flavour, with quite significant age for its price.

EDIT:

I'm going to start compiling these suggestions by region with prices, probably won‚Äôt get to it until tomorrow. Thanks!"

Long time lurker, first time poster - need some advice.

My wedding is coming up in early April, and I wanted to provide all our wedding guests with something bubbly upon their arrival (~20 bottles). After Christmas, our local wine shop had an excellent sale, and I decided to jump on a few bottles of a sparkling white perfect for spring. (I‚Äôd have preferred champagne, but it is what it is. I needed 20 bottles of the same kind, this is what they had.)

Now I have to store them until early April. I have a wine fridge, but it isn‚Äôt big enough for all 20 bottles.

I‚Äôve also read conflicting advice as to whether sparkling wine should be stored horizontally or vertically, and the fact that it‚Äôs just a few months seems to matter as well.

Any advice is so welcome, thank you in advance! Cheers!"

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for two different meals picked by my companion.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Broccoli Cottage ""Cannelloni"". Recipe: https://divaliciousrecipes.com/broccoli-ricotta-cannelloni/ . We will use cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

The second is a Cauliflower Pork Fried Rice. Recipe: https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/cauliflower-pork-fried-rice/

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

I do have a couple of wines that should go sooner rather than later - but unsure if these would make good pairings with these dishes. The estimated drink-by date are underneath.

We plan to take the train from Porto to Ferr√£o, where Quinta Nova is (our accommodations). We don't want to take a car so we can imbibe.

1. We want to take a boat tour to sightsee. Quinta Nova offers one from Ferr√£o to Pinh√£o. Is this stretch particularly beautiful? Or should we look for a boat tour that goes from Pinh√£o eastward? If the latter, any recommendations for an operator?

2. Then we plan to go to dinner at DOC. It is on the other side of the river from Quinta Nova, so we are thinking to take the train from Ferrao to Covelinhas and cross there by boat to Folgosa. Has anyone done this? Then we to take a taxi/hired driver home. Is it possible to find a taxi at DOC, or should we pre-arrange?

3. For our second day, we would love to bop around winery to winery, but it seems like it is going to be extremely pricey to hire a private driver and that nearly all tours start/end in Porto. We are thinking of just go to Pinh√£o and doing a few near there by walking/taxi (Bomfim, Seixo, and la Rosa). Are we making a mistake by doing this? Will it be overrun with tourists?

What gives with these clones? If clones are supposed to be genetically identical, why do we give these grapes a different name?

In my previous life as a corporate and private wine consultant one of my clients was a boat charter company - after building a strong relationship with them, they would go on to refer me unknowingly to what would be my biggest private client. After months of emails and phone calls for wine orders and recommendations for dinners they would have, I got invited over as this persons Housekeeper wanted my opinion on their cellar. I would spend the next few days creating a spreadsheet of everything they had - stuff to drink now, throw out and keep with recommended drinking windows. It was an extensive list that went into the hundreds of items and would take me a month to finish properly with researching bottles. I sent the spreadsheet off and didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a fortnight. Eventually the housekeeper got back to me and couldn‚Äôt believe the data within it, and asked to send an invoice. I replied back it was no charge (they were already spending crazy amounts for dinner parties and gifts). I didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a week and got invited over to theirs again for coffee and lunch - and that‚Äôs when this wine came out. It would be the first of a number of crazy ones I had only ever read about, yet here I was now having them at this persons house. For lunch, it was some ham and salad rolls! The wine of course is what you would expect from such a name and vintage and perfectly cellared - powerful, fresh blue fruit still present with a deep blue jam flavour, graphite and a smoked wood flavour. The finish lasted minutes. Crazy wine.

I was wondering how much it would be worth, I'm new to this community so I don't know most terms. The label is slightly damaged but easily readable, there is a bit of wine out of the bottle but it has never been opened before. The Cork is slightly damaged. 

I saw the exact same bottle in new state for ‚Ç¨925 and was wondering how much our bottle would be worth with these cosmetic damages.

Any recommendations for a Bordeaux with similar notes but at a more affordable range? A bottle of that would set me back about 220 USD, looking form something in the 50s to 100 that could be a good alternative! Open to other grape varietals as well! Cheers!!!"

Last year while on vacation our hotel room was robbed - and we didn‚Äôt have great information on what we had with us to provide evidence to insurance for reimbursement. 
So this year we have been electronically cataloguing what‚Äôs in our -owned- home - what the items are, photos, and any evidence of purchase along with a link to the item for cost valuation. 

Finalizing all this is a question regarding Home Ownership and what it covers - 
I‚Äôve started collecting wines that I enjoy, roughly 150 bottles so far, and have them in the basement in racks. I am tracking these in CellarTracker in addition to the above method. 

Now if something were to happen to the house: does your home owners insurance cover your cellar or do people have an additional rider? I don‚Äôt have $100.000+ worth of wine so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd need to but wanted to put out the question to others.

I have a friend headed over to NZ who owes me a favor and I figured he could ferry me back a handful of great NZ wines that might not be as easily found here on the West Coast of the US.

I'd be happy spending about $30-$50 USD (45-75 NZD) a bottle on average and wouldn't mind some variety.

I guess this has been asked a few times on /r/wine before, but I'm still not sure so I thought I'd ask again!

&amp;#x200B;

I don't work in wine, but am an enthusiast and have learnt quite a lot from reading online (Jancis Robinson / Wikipedia). I also have done a beginner's winetasting course, which was great fun. 

I recently got myself the study book for WSET Level 2 and have read most of it - I learnt a lot from the winemaking section, but would say I was already pretty familiar with the different grape varieties / standard regions.

I'd like to take a WSET course (onsite at their school in London), but I'm not sure if I should go for Level 2 or Level 3. Level 3 seems like it would be more interesting, and I'd learn a lot more. (I'm also pretty confident I could pass the Level 2 exam right now.) But from reading on here it seems like there's a huge jump between Level 2 and Level 3, and I'm not sure if I'll have enough tasting experience to get enough out of Level 3, or if it'll just be too difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on what I should go for / how to work out if Level 3 would be out of my reach?"

Are there any big red flags that would steer you away from a particular bottle (like brands that are well-known to be subpar)?

Hi! I work at a liquor store in sw Missouri! I love my job, as it works really well with my school schedule.

I do love wine, but I'm learning. I dont know nearly as much as my coworkers do about it.

Some work drama happened and the wine managers position was dissolved and she quit. I mentioned a few months ago that I would really like to round myself out and work in the wine room so I can learn! My boss took that, and decided that I should run the wine room! So here I am, a total beer guy... with his own wine room... 

Now before you jump the gun, I've read the FAQ and the beginners guide so I do have what I think is a minimum base knowledge about wine. But what I'm here today for is... help, honestly. 

I havent tasted much wine and I dont have the budget to just buy a bunch right now. I'm also just not really familiar with how to help potential customers. In my beer section, I've had most of what people ask about, so helping is usually pretty easy. But if someone were to ask me the differences between different sav' blancs, I know that I would just be a bumbling idiot. 

I know some of you will say ""just do your best and try stuff and make your own opinions as you go!"", which I will absolutely be doing! But I just need some help. 

Tell me your opinions on wines! Tell me your hot takes! Tell me what gets your goat about this one winery! Tell me what I might expect from some of my customers and how I can sort of bullshit some of my way though this period! Anything from anyone is going to be a huge help! So please dont be afraid!

I drunk some Goethe grape wine from Brazil and I had to admit that I was quite surprised with the wine. It was not bad at all. Also I understand it has a limited potential for ageing and complexity, but for a young and more affordable wine, it was pretty satisfatory.

 Had you guys tried some hybrid grape, and how it was?"

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals picked by my companion.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Chickpea Cauliflower Eggplant Tomato Stew. Recipe: http://eastvanvegan.com/eggplant-chickpea-tagine-vegan-gf/ Website appears to be down but the ingredients are listed. Harissa, chili, mint, parsley as seasonings.

The second is a Meatloaf with Sauteed Cabbage, Leek and Celeriac Fries. Recipes: https://www.karlasnordickitchen.com/skillet-meatloaf-with-sauteed-cabbage/ and https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/celeriac-chips/

The final one is a Tofu Spinach Stew Dish (Vegan Palak Paneer)
. Recipe: https://gourmandelle.com/vegan-palak-paneer/ 

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

I have a shortlist of wines I think should be drunk sooner than later.
These are listed below (with the estimated drink by date).

From this list, but I can choose outside it, have 200 bottles, I'd pick the 2010 Vi√±a William F√®vre Carm√©n√®re La Misi√≥n Reserva or 2013 Casa Silva Carm√©n√®re Santa Tierra Estate with the meatloaf. For the others, I'd be less sure. Especially the Tofu Spinach Palak Paneer is an odd duck.  One of the reasons I'd like to ask advice to the experienced folk in this sub :-)

537,eiox8d,**MWC Experimental Series #1! January 2020 Selection Post!**,wine,"Hello everyone and Happy New year!  I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season, and welcome to the January installment of the Monthly Wine Challenge! Thanks to some wonderful dialogue in the last couple of months, I felt that with the new year, it is time to try something new for the MWC.  For the most part, there won't be much of a difference.  I'm still going to hold to the format of region and grape.  But I'm also going to switch it up from time to time, and I'm hoping that this will stop the stagnation that has been plaguing us lately.  I'm going to be calling this the Experimental Series, inspired by a series of scotch that my dad has from the Glenfiddich distillery.  And with that, there is no time like the present.  So, with that  in mind, lets discover what this month has in store for us:  


**Grape:** Pinot Noir  
**Country and Region #1:** USA, Pacific North West  
**Country and Region #2:** New Zealand, Any  


Thats right!  Not one, but TWO regions this month!  I've always wanted to try to include comparative tastings to the MWC, but until now, I was unsure how to do it.  So, for the first entry into the MWC Experimental Series, I have decided on pinot noir from the PNW of the US, with one from anywhere in New Zealand.  As I am not very familiar with either region, I felt this was a good place to start.  Feel free to post notes for multiple bottles.  If you have 2 from one region and one from another, go ahead!  Can only find one region, and not the other, thats ok to.  Just post what notes you have.  Otherwise, the format will not be much different from previous challenges.    


So, just like with past MWC entries, us on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.), and e) if you preferred one style over the other.

If you are new to wine tasting, [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/2015/08/25/how-to-taste-wine/) has a great article to get you going.  Have fun choosing your wine, and I will see you all on the 15th!

See you on the 15th!  If you have suggestions for future comparative tastings, or just a suggestion for one of our regular tastings, please feel free to message me.  And as a reminder, if you have not posted your notes from the December 2019 Challenge, you will be able to do so in this thread until January 7th."
538,ej392b,Suggestion for a wine.,wine,"I'm very unfamiliar with wine, but I decided recently on a future gift for my nieces that were recently born: I want to buy them each a bottle of wine to age at home until they either marry or turn 30 (whichever occurs first).

I've been trying to do some research in regards to good wines that can be aged about 30 years but thus far, the only suggestion I've found is to not buy something that costs less than $25.

I'd like some suggestions for what wines I should consider for this and what the wines are like. Thank you!"

My wife told me to pick a wine class I wanted to attend as a Christmas present.  Having read a lot and knowing what I""m good at (acidity, alcohol, identifying oak, earth aromas, and general wine knowledge) and what I'm bad at (fruit aromas and floral aromas), I was wondering if a wine aroma kit might be a better investment.

I'm good at identifying oak and general wine structure, but more than a little embarrassed, that I don't get raspberry rather than just ""general fruit"".  I can get barnyard, earthy, mushroom, but rose vs. marigold or strawberry vs blackberry and I'm just guessing.  Weird thing is, I taste a lot better than I smell.  Okay, that sounded bad . . . uh, my sense of taste of those things is much better than me trying to smell them before drinking.

I've read good things about Le Nez du Vin, but man that's expensive ($400).  I thought about doing my own, but I have a lot of other time commitments.  So a kit is probably worth it.  Maybe?

What are your all's thoughts on courses versus the aroma kits?  Anybody done the WSET2 or 3 stuff?  Recommend an aroma kit?

Thanks."

For some background, I never drank wine until meeting my current fiancee. Her family is big on wine, mine liquor. My new father in law in particular is a huge wine connoisseur. Every time we're together we're opening mostly $75+ bottles. 

My fiancee and I are now in Oregon and have obviously discovered the point noir. But our budget is more $10-15 bottles. Every time the in laws are in town we're going to the best wineries or wine bars. Spent yesterday tasting at beaux freres and Bergstrom and came home with a few cases gifted to us as well. This is pretty typical. 

So my question I guess. I've been fortunate to try enough amazing wines that i can enjoy it and tell when I'm drinking a really nice wine.

605,ehmgwv,Question about returning flawed bottle,wine,"I would like some advice from restaurant professionals on how I could have better handled a situation I was in last night. I was out to dinner at a moderately upscale restaurant with like 12 people last night and ordered a bottle of 2016 ridge zin for myself. The wine was obviously flawed, cooked, had no fresh fruit, smelled like off prunes. Overall palate was thin and unappetizing. As to not cause a scene and get chastised by my non wine drinking extended family I took my glass to the bar to get his opinion and get a new bottle. He smelled it and thought it was port before I even told him what wine I had ordered. The waitress comes to the table and takes the bottle and returns with a decanter filled with a ‚Äúnew‚Äù ridge zin. This time I try it and it either has the same flaw or is the same wine since I never saw her open the new bottle. I shrugged it off again as to not be called picky or something by my family. I should have probably complained but just let it go. Was I justified in returning the bottle? And how could I have handled it differently? Seems like bad practice to return with a new wine in a decanter.

Update: I called and spoke with the manager and he agreed it was wrong of the server to bring the new wine decanted and not open it in front of me. He also said he‚Äôs gonna pop another bottle open to see if the others are also flawed. Issued a full refund for the wine and was very nice and respectful."

Admittedly I know so little about wine and still feel that way after researching it. But this wine could get my wife into it and then I'd have a partner to take on the hobby."

I find myself calling people out more and more (in a relatively nice way) cause I think it just looks silly...

Nose: Immensely dense and compley. At first, loads of red and dark fruit. Ripe cherries, blackberries, plums, blueberries.. Then, with swirling, olives, laurel berry leaves, tobacco and leather. I spent over 10 minutes with just sniffing.

Palate: It's like a fruit tsunami overwhelming yor. Needs some time to identify all the aromes, because there are so many. Everyhing I got in the nose is also present on the palate, with a great clarity and precision. It's like looking on the many facings of a diamond that changes its appearens when you turn it around in the light. The acidity and density is amazing, the 15,5% feel like 13,5%. The wine is at the same time overwhelming and elegant. The finish is basically endless, adding on the primary notes salty caramel, leather, burnt almonds, cinnamon and eucalyptus. Despite the complexity it screams for the next sip.

Score: 97/100, I agree with the high parker scores on this winery.

On top, it's really affordable, I payd around 60‚Ç¨ three years ago. The only wine that I rated higher this year was 2016 Figeac, which sells for around 250‚Ç¨ at the moment."

In my experience the wine industry is infamous for price not correlating with quality. I've had some very expensive bottles of decent wine and some affordable bottles of fantastic wine.

With wine I have no clue.




Do I buy two ‚Ç¨50 bottles, three ‚Ç¨40, or 5 ‚Ç¨20 bottles?
I definitely don't want to buy just one bottle but I don't know how many quality bottles I can get before it's definitely not great wines.

HOWEVER, there might be an exception to this. In South Australia, the weather gets hot and it is the least mountainous of the major viticultural regions. Florida's Sugarloaf mountain seems to resemble some of this geography. Perhaps this should be a descent place to grow Shiraz in the American southeast, since Shiraz loves high alcohol content and high alcohol is a result of heat.  


That being said, this can only be done on a cold year. Florida used to have cool winters, but climate change has shifted this in recent years.

676,egmtw4,Weird experience with Riesling,wine,"Sorry if this isn‚Äôt a normal post for this sub, but my SO and I are dying to solve this. 

My SO (we‚Äôll call her Oli) and I were at a super nice restaurant in Denver and while we‚Äôve both had a fair share of wine, we had never had Riesling before. She decided to give it a shot and ordered a glass of belle pente Riesling from willamette valley 2009. At first, the wine was fantastic! It was very sweet and smooth and encouraged me to order a glass. 

But after this first sip is when we became completely lost in what was going on. 

Oli noticed something in her glass (small piece of sweater lint maybe) and pulled it out with her knife.  She wasn‚Äôt worried about whatever it was and didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss. But, after taking whatever it was out, the wine took on a completely new flavor. A new strangely acidic/chemical taste completely overpowered the wines original flavor. 

This obviously spurred her to order a new glass, with our best theory being the metal of the knife effected the flavor in some way we were too unknowledgeable to understand. My glass arrived with her new one, and thus our confusion continued to pile up. 

Both of our glasses had this weird new flavor that the original sip did not have in any way. At a complete loss, we googled Riesling to make sure we weren‚Äôt being dumb about the experience of really nice wines. What we found on google was this as the top result: ‚ÄúRiesling is a white grape variety which originated in the Rhine region. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines.‚Äù - from Wikipedia

So here‚Äôs my question for you wine aficionados here on r/wine, are we uncultured in wines (especially nicer ones like Riesling) or did we have an experience that is clearly not what is supposed to happen?

TLDR: SO and I got Riesling for the first time and have no clue if we were poisoned or just uncultured in Riesling."

&amp;#x200B;

My current wine key has a finely serrated foil cutter and it just doesn't cut quite like when I first got it.  I watched a few videos just now that people from here linked and the guys cut the foil in two straight cuts.  I'm over here sawing at it for like 45 seconds.  Is there anything I can do to sharpen it?  The flat side was starting to roll over so I took it to a whetstone and that helped a little.  Could it be a technique thing?  I noticed from the videos that I'm doing everything else right, and if I had a sharper knife I wouldn't be sawing at it.  When I try doing two quick cuts like in the videos the blade doesn't cut all of the way through the foil, so removing it is sloppy unless I go back around.

687,egde90,Your Favorite Great Value Burgundies,wine,"In light of the wonderful tasting notes that have been showing up recently, I thought it would be nice to collectively share and discuss some of our favorite values in Burgundy. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts!


Some of my favorite values are:

White:


-PYCM Bourgogne Blanc: A rather well-made wine and an excellent introduction to the house style. His Pernand-Vergelesses wines also punch well above their weight and can sometimes be found under $50. I feel that PYCM's wines are a good example of the importance of winemaking and terroir; though with the lesser wines you miss out on the terroir, his signature is still there (and I happen to love it).


Red:


-Hudelot-No√´llat Bourgogne Rouge: A beautiful introduction to red burgundy, all red-fruited elegance and grace. While lacking some depth, it's simply a delicious wine -- another example where I just love the style.


Also, recently I tried a 2016 Domaine Bart Marsannay and was not expecting much -- it was a producer I had never heard of from a lesser village. However, this wine really outperformed. At first a bit closed, but this opened up to reveal a deeply dark-fruited wine with striking purity. A strong mineral backbone and streak of acidity along with a tight tannic structure implies that this will benefit from some cellar time. Was really impressed by this wine."

The way I use wine folly right now, it seems like I use the books more as reference books rather than reading them cover to cover.

I checked the contents of OWC on google books and I got confused. I couldn't see all pages of course but most of the visible pages were just some sort of index.

712,efw6jf,I'm looking for the perfect gift for my father.,wine,"First of all, this is my first post in this subreddit, I love how there's such a nice community for something so old and wonderful as wine. Now, I need a piece of advice from you. I'm a young Spanish guy that discovered some month ago that his father ""secretly"" started a rather curious collection.

My father wants to collect (Football-cards-album style) the ""stickers"" (front and back labels on the bottle) of each one of Spanish wine designations of origin, let me explain: in Spain there are a certain number of certificated wine producers, each one of them with their own ""Name"", ""Brand"" and designation of origin that they share with other wine producers of the same region.

And the thing is, that my father wants at least one of those bottles to add to it's collection, Imagine that in the region of MADRID there are 2 designations of origin with 6 different wine producers, so my father need 2 bottles, one for each designation of origin of the region of MADRID. You can find more and better information about this in this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_wine_regions) webpage.

Now, what's the problem? I have no idea what to do.

I would like to help my father to complete his collection with a nice gift (I have to add the fact that in Spain we have another Christmas-gifts-and-presents-situation on January 6th, more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi)). Here are some of my first ideas:

I have been thinking about buying a bottle from one of the 2 archipelagos of Spain: Balearic and Canary Islands, it's seems like those islands have their own designations of origin that are very hard to find in the Spanish peninsula (where we live), so I think it would be a nice present, the thing is that I have no idea which should I pick.

Also, while looking through Amazon I discovered the concept of ""Submarine Wines"" that it seems like it's quite a thing in Spain. The bottles looks so cool and unique with all the sea stuff attached to it, here is an [example](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07KVJQYT6/ref=sspa_dk_detail_2?psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWkFWQjRGT0pZNFdTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjkzNDgzWU02Q0ZYSkdRSEpJJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzNDkyOTgzTFZSUDM5QlRIWjlNJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsMiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) .

And my last thought was trying to look for any kind of accessory or tool that would help my father get the stickers from the bottle. I did a bit of detective work while he was sleeping and I have been taking some pictures of how it's he doing it. It's seems like he submerges the bottles in just water for a couple of days, then with a razor blade he extract the stickers, with the little glue left in the stickers it paste them in some kitchen-super-dry-paper and let them dry for some hours, then he puts them in his folder.

The pictures I took:

https://preview.redd.it/lr75m6b6lz641.jpg?width=1909&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a381bbfdc7e243b65f58301ae709d33966f6b101

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hnjt6ev8lz641.jpg?width=1793&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5113fcd5749a4a23b7cbc182af0299303479372

  

https://preview.redd.it/2ew8xo6blz641.jpg?width=1965&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d5d0972bc7dea2daf084e4a5c54245b7c520459

It's seems like he wants to get more stickers before making any kind of sorting by type, year or designations of origin, by now he's just stacking them together in the folder.

Additional information: My father it's not a crazy wine drinker, he drinks very casually, not everyday. Also, as a lot of you would know wine in Spain is very cheap, we do not live in a mansion or drive expensive cars, the most expensive wine he have bought for the collection was around 21‚Ç¨, being said that I wouldn't mind spending 50‚Ç¨ in a bottle of wine for my father (like the submarine bottle linked before) but more expensive than that... don't think so.

So that's the situation right now, I would like to know your opinion on all of this, what do you think It would be a nice gift for him!

Thank you so much for reading my post! Hope you all have a nice day, Cheers ! Proost ! Sant√© ! Salute ! Kanpai ! Sk√•l ! and Salud !"

(1) Chicken Mushroom Tomato Zoodles (Recipe: http://www.perchancetocook.com/2017/01/23/paleo-mushroom-kale-and-spiced-ground-chicken-tomato-sauce-gf/). We'll likely drop or replace the kale.

(2) Yogurt Beet Pumpkin Pizza (Recipe: https://www.blueberryvegan.com/en/winterliche-knusprige-pizzaschiffchen-mit-kuerbis-rote-bete-und-gruenkohl/). Again, we'll likely drop or replace the kale (with spinach?) and perhaps add feta for some added protein/flavour.

This morning I found out that optimal storage for Dom Perignon is in a dark cool cellar. The temperature in my living room is 20 degrees Celsius or 68 Fahrenheit. Stupid I know but I am new to Vintage Wine. =/ 

I am kind of freaking out because I am worried this will spoil the Dom Perignon. It has been sitting under the tree for only 2 days and Christmas will come up in 3 days. Can this champagne become noticeably ruined in this timespan? There is some sunlight in the room, though not much and it's still in a box and wrapped under the tree.

What should I do at this point? Should I put it in my garage cabinet? it's about 0 celsius or 32 Fahrenheit there. But I don't want a sudden switch in temp to ruin it.

Please help!

tl;dr can storing a box of Dom Perignon 2008 at 20\*c in a room with not much exposure to sunlight for a few days ruin the bottle??"

I have decided to get into the world of vintage port, a decision largely based on my love for the drink and the relative cheapness of the product. However, in learning about this I fear I may have ruined my first bottle of vintage. 

I purchased a bottle of 2016 Barros in April of this year and have stored it on its side. However, rather than having it in a cool dry place, it has been in my bedroom (I live in the UK) which can be slightly warm over the summer but much cooler in the winter (i.e. now). It is in a box on the bottle of a bookshelf type affair.

My question it, is there a way to tell if this is now ruined and what is my best course of action for the bottle going forward? I know I need to store it for 20 years+ but I just don't know if I should now abandon this particular bottle.

Going forward I will be a lot more careful with the port I purchase."

People ask, ""Ive seen those, but never knew how they worked"" or ""Ive never seen an opener like that."" 

I was showing an employee how to use it a few weeks ago, and she cracked the neck of a bottle.

Yesterday, i chipped the lip of a bottle, and was told i cant use my Ahso anymore.

As a former winemaker trained in Bordeaux and with 10 years experience making fine wine in 7 countries, while with 20 years in the wine industry now (6+ years working at Wine-Searcher HQ in New Zealand), and with WSET Diploma accreditation, my aim to share EVERYTHING that I know about wine in video form, so it's digestible and easy to understand even without an scientific background. We're going to cover the whole world over time.

It'll take time as there is an awful lot to cover since I worked in France (mainly Bordeaux like Chateau Margaux), but also Spain, Tuscany, California, Australia and NZ and still learning and sharing more on a daily basis.

But any support, topic suggestions, or feedback from the wine community, you guys, could help tremendously sharing the passion and knowledge of wine. I'm not trying to teach wine, as I think we all see it differently, and we all have to learn from each other. So it's more about sharing views on regions, accessories, wineries and wines to start conversations and exchange.

I'd like to run more polls so we can prioritize topics to cover first, and navigate it all with your help.

Anyways...

894,ecw5xv,Gift Question: Book to compliment Wine Folly,wine,"Hey all, looking for a gift for a newly minted wine lover. They're mostly focused on wine in the context of food pairings although drink plenty of wine sans-food. They're pretty excited to expand their general knowledge and are currently struggling a little with pulling out specific flavor notes, but I imagine that comes with time.

Currently they own and use the Wine Folly book and have been hinting that it may be time to 'upgrade' to the Magnum edition. My question is, is there enough content to justify owning both? Are there other books that may be similar, but contain a bit more information?

I've done a bit of searching and the Wine Bible seems to be oft recommended, however seems to be more focused on history, geography and other information about wine as opposed to the act of tasting it.

I saw a recommendation for "" Wine: A Tasting Course: Every Class in a Glass"", which seems to be a step in the right direction but also may be too similar?

I thought about picking up several wines as opposed to information, but they enjoy the shopping experience and chatting with the shop owner, so I'll leave the wine buying to them. Thanks!"

We like wine so ended up at a few places worth mentioning for future posterity. Turns out, wine culture in Spain is just as awesome as you'd expect. And it is very accessible for those without big budgets. 

We didn't do any ""wine touring"" per se -- just drinking glasses at bars, and a few bottles at home along the way. This is more of a post on the places and their wine focus than tasting notes on any wine in particular. 

**Barcelona**

* [La Catalista](https://www.lacatalista.com/) . This was our first stop after arriving in Barcelona. It was raining, our AirBnB host was running late, so we walked 50 steps to the closest bar we could find. We ended up coming back for at least a glass every day for the remainder of our trip. It's a wine bar owned by an American ex-pat serving exclusively Catalan wine along with some seriously good food. Focus is on smaller producers making low-intervention wine, especially with less than common local varieties. My first wine there was an a fun off-dry, oxidative white made with [Malvasia de Sitges](https://i.imgur.com/p1PF4Nf.jpg) that was super delicious. Other memorable bits included this [gran reserve cava with cerviche](https://i.imgur.com/qKiFETE.jpg). (And the sumoll in the background was the first time I'd ever heard of or tried that grape.) An example of their [rotating wild card menu](https://i.imgur.com/czZPfgh.jpg) . Overall just a fun little wine bar with a super friendly staff who likes local, well-made wine. *Whose it for:* Folks who want local wine, but need to talk about it in English

* [Quimet y Quimet](https://www.quimetquimet.com/): Dinner our first night. Yes its busy, yes there are tourists, yes there are locals. They are a bit pushy, but damn was everything we ate tasty. We started with their homemade [vermouth and Quimet y Quimet beer]([https://i.imgur.com/YlC6UoI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YlC6UoI.jpg)) before sharing some cava and a few more appetizers. Nice thing is you can buy [anything off the wall](https://i.imgur.com/MyxfEnh.jpg) at very reasonable prices to have with your delicious food. No we didn't drink Vina Tondonia. *Whose it for:* Tourists, locals, people who want vermouth a good bottle selection and lots of tasty seafood. 

* [La Graciosa](https://www.facebook.com/lagraciosabcn/): Definitely a nerdy and serious place for natural wine lovers. Lots of funky weird stuff, but didn't take themselves too seriously. Only remembered to snap a pic of the [whites we drank](https://i.imgur.com/7orxNQZ.jpg). Wish we could've stayed longer but they had an event about to start which included a bunch of unlabeled bottles being pulled out of suitcases. If you're into the natty side of natural wine this is your place. *Whose it for:* People open to new wine experiences on the natty wine end of things.

* [Bar Salvatge](https://barsalvatge.com/): This is what happens when natty wine goes mainstream. Loud, popular environment. Ten wines available on tap in different levels of fritzy and fruity to brett-bombs. Not to my taste but an interesting riff to see what happens when this style of natural wines make it to a non-wine nerd crowd who just likes a new approach and feeling to a wine bar. *Whose it for* You want loud vibrant scene, beautiful people, and cheap natty wine from the barrel.

* [La Vinya del Senyor](https://www.facebook.com/vinyadelsenyor/): Stumbled across this place wandering around the neighborhood, and what a delight. Nice outside patio, cozy inside, great seafood and great variety of classic wines by the glass. Not the cheapest place, but compared to what you spend in the US, still a bargin. Oh, and if you like sherry -- they've got a full page of it by the glass. This [manzanilla and oyster pairing](https://i.imgur.com/91SwDvO.jpg) was the pairing of the trip for me. They also had quite the selection of wines on Coravin allowing you taste some spendier bottles like this [local elegant and powerful merlot blend](https://i.imgur.com/nb3BS11.jpg). *Whose it for:* Someone looking for a quite, romantic few glasses on a beautiful patio. And sherry nerds.

* [Boedga Maestrazgo](http://bodegamaestrazgo.com/): [Half bottle shop, half wine bar.](https://i.imgur.com/tzg1A4T.jpg) Everything from very inexpensive (3euro/liter) bulk wine to go, to a whole range of quality producers. Super friendly staff. We drank glasses of this [very nicely acidic bierzo](https://i.imgur.com/7cBmPTz.jpg) that reminded us of cab franc from the Loire which is one of our go to faves. Highly recommend a stop here for a bottle to go, to get mix for sangria, and a glass along the way. We grabbed an inexpensive (15euro?) bottle of 2010 reserva cava for [our picnic the next day.](https://i.imgur.com/5gwpSmT.jpg). *Whose it for*: Someone who needs to buy a few bottles, make sangria, and is looking for that neighborhood bottle shop with well informed staff.

* [Bar Brutal](http://cancisa.cat/): The older sibling of Bar Salvatge and one we enjoyed a good bit more. More toned down from full on natty. Night we happened in was a tasting of Christian Tschida wines -- with [not quite-full pours of 5 cuvees](https://i.imgur.com/py1F6Gc.jpg) for 15 euros a pop.  Somms here were eager to talk about each one and just seemed to really be enjoying their nights. Tons of regulars mixed in with the many tourists you always find in this bit of town. *Whose it for*: You're not cool enough for Bar Salvatge, but you like natural wine and a busy atmosphere with passionate people.

and we saved the big dog for the final night

* [Monvinic](http://www.monvinic.com/): This place is serious. Huge lists, awesome by the glass selection. Quiet atmosphere and very focused customers. A very different vibe, service not eager to explain things to you as perhaps they assume you already know a good bit. The ipad based lists are impressive and--frankly--necessary for navigating. We tasted through 8 half glasses, had some simple tapas (bread and cheese) and were out for about 60euro. Started with [two very different whites](https://i.imgur.com/OuYzuq8.jpg) \-- the muscat being just so pretty, fresh and full of flowers. On to some local reds -- [a small batch sumoll and a marselan](https://i.imgur.com/ReFq2Dm.jpg). The marselan -- a grape I hadn't been exposed to -- was the standout here as bringing just the right amount of cab sauv seriousness to the fruit profile. A bottle I'll certainly look for in the future. Then two more Spanish -- a sulphur and white-pepper nosed [red from the Canary islands](https://i.imgur.com/LTPz2Db.jpg), followed up by a powerful, smooth and just-the-right-amount-of-oak [gran reserva rioja.](https://i.imgur.com/iikjexf.jpg) That was supposed to be the end of it, but we decided we had time for two more wines which generally would be outside our budget. So we had a glass of [1er cru Burgundy](https://i.imgur.com/N2WvbGR.jpg) (which reminded me why I can't drink Burgundy often because I'll fall in love as it just tastes to me like some Platonic ideal of wine in my head, and I can't afford it). And then finished on a [2012 Pomerol](https://i.imgur.com/0ahOQv7.jpg) \-- the fiance's favorite of the night. *Whose it for:* You don't mind a stuffier atmosphere if it means you get to drink incredible wines.

**Toledo**

* No wine bars to mention but we bought [this bottle of ""#Garagewine""](https://i.imgur.com/vThAlEG.jpg) on a whim at a [well stocked local shop](http://casacuartero.com/). After drinking overly-young-overly-oak Rioja for a few days, this was the expression of local cencibel ( Tempranillo ) I needed: medium bodied, fruit forward, plenty of acid, lots of cherries. 

**Madrid**

* [Vino y Compania](http://vinoycompania.blogspot.com/): A small neighborhood wine shop right around the corner from our place. Super friendly staff, big selections in every price range, focused on smaller producers. We had a [few tasty bottles from there](https://i.imgur.com/daGkr5w.jpg) (and one great bottle of ""cuvee"" saison from a nearby beer shop.)
* [La Venencia](https://goo.gl/maps/VHSr1vPCSNMrv8Sm7): Prior to this trip I'd had sherry maybe twice in my life, to start off fancy dinners in England. I was young, it wasn't memorable. This place is going to be to blame for a new habit. Holy shit is it what my palate needed after a bunch of oaked Riojas. Sherry only, all of it straight from the cask. Fino and Manzanilla for 1.80euro,  Amontillado, Oloroso, Palo Cortado for 2.20euro per pour. Simple tapas including the best free olives you'll get anywhere. The vibrancy and slightly yeasty characteristics of fino were tops for me but all were just so new to my taste buds that it was hard to process. No tipping, [no pictures](https://i.imgur.com/HC1h2jB.jpg) (yes I failed, that's our tab). We had a drink here in the afternoon, then came back and closed the place down that night. The fiance and I have an expression for when we find a place we want to melt into for a long time: ""I live here now."" I said that about La Venecia from the 3rd day of our trip when we found it, til we left 6 days later from Barcelona. *Whose it for* Those who need nothing more from life than perfect fresh sherry, simple food, and an interior that hasn't changed since 1930. 

Hope this can be of use to future wine travelers to these cities, and would love to read about other places local wine scenes. Sometimes its just too hard to get out to the vineyards and experiencing a massive variety of wine with passionate people when we travel is the bees knees."

As of right now, I pull corks, though if the account has a Coravin I'll use it.  For any open bottles, I'll roll around with them the next day (after testing in the AM for freshness and never presenting after the 30-hour mark); any Coravin-ed bottles I consider viable for one week, less if more than a quarter of the bottle was poured.

I have been looking at the [Repour](https://www.repour.com/pages/how-it-works) and [ZOS Halo](https://zos.wine/pages/the-technology) systems.  My primary concern with them is how travel will affect the wine: I am driving a lot every day, including elevation changes (from sea level and over mountain ranges) and winding backroads, not to mention the agitation the bottles face as the sample bag rolls along the sidewalk (sometimes over cobblestones too...).  Conceptually I am wondering how well they would keep sealed under these conditions, if the wine splashing up into the oxygen-absorbing material would compromise/negate it, and what a buyer would think when I present a bottle thusly sealed to him/her.

Are there any road-warrior reps out there with experience using these and if yes, are they worthwhile?  Would it be better to bite the bullet and get a Coravin for selective use (I wouldn't use it for the value-end of the portfolio obviously), or stick to the current gameplan eschewing all preservation methods and open fresh bottles?"

U.S. Trade Representative
Executive Office of the President
600 17th Street, NW
Washington, DC 20006

 

Re: Opposition to Tariffs on Imported Wine from the European Union

 

Dear Amb. Lighthizer:

 

I am writing as a customer and consumer of imported and domestic wines that is concerned with the multiple rounds of tariffs that are being imposed and considered on wine from the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù). I strongly urge you not to punish me, or my fellow wine lovers, or hardworking wine retailers, for problems we didn‚Äôt cause. It‚Äôs unfair at face value. You should punish those responsible. Punishing Airbus and their suppliers and French digital services companies would be much more effective, as well as fair.

Beginning on October 18, 2019, the U.S. Government imposed a 25-percent tariff on certain French wine as part of retaliatory tariffs against the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù) after the World Trade Organization authorized retaliation for the EU‚Äôs failure to comply with WTO rulings on subsidies provided to Airbus. All the while Airbus itself was only issued a 10% tariff. I understand that a 100-percent tariff is proposed on French sparkling wine (consisting mostly of champagne) and that this tariff is part of the Section 301 duties imposed on imports from France as a result of the country‚Äôs Digital Services Tax (‚ÄúDST‚Äù). Finally, on December 10, 2019, USTR proposed imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent on all wines from the EU.

Because of these import tariffs, the prices will go up dramatically for wine. Margins on wine are extremely small, and the sale of wine is highly regulated, with virtually every state imposing a three-tier distribution system with markups occurring at each tier of distribution. Thus, a 25-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 50-percent increase and a 100-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 150-percent increase in prices for a consumer like me.

 

There is no substitute for imports of wine from the EU. Wines from the EU are different from domestic wines and wines from other countries as a matter of consumer taste. In addition, because it takes many years to plant new grape vineyards and allow the vineyards to produce mature fruit that can be harvested to make wine, it will take at least a decade before the U.S. domestic wine industry could ever be in a position to begin replacing wine imports from the EU.

 

As a wine consumer, I do not understand why individual consumers like me and small U.S. businesses should suffer because of a dispute involving Boeing and Airbus or France‚Äôs digital services tax. Retaliatory tariffs on these matters should target Airbus and their suppliers who benefitted from the subsidies, and French digital services companies.

Welcome to the first tasting notes post for 2020!  It sounds like this might prove to be a popular change to the MWC based on the selection post, and I hope that it is echoed in this thread!  I hope everyone has had a chance to find their selections.  I had to order mine in (NZ pinot is not very easy to find here locally beyond Kim Crawford.  But I was able to find a couple, and I hope you did too.  If not, no worry, just post what you were ablle to find!   As a reminder, this  months selection is:

**Grape:** Pinot Noir  
**Country and Region #1:** USA, Pacific North West  
**Country and Region #2:** New Zealand, Any

That's right!  Two wines this month!  And as a reminder, if you can only find wine from one region and not the other, thats quite alright.  Just post what you can.  Remember, in your notes, be sure to include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle  and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, the  country/region, the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall  recommendation (whether beautiful or terrible, food pairings, etc.).

I'm a 23 year-old man from the Netherlands working at a wine bar and busy with the Dutch equivalent of WSET3.

For the summer, I'm looking for a winery (preferably in France or Italy) to work at. I could help with tours, hospitality services or some others jobs if needed. I'm not interested in earning any money, just looking for a place to stay and learn about wine for about two weeks.

If anyone has a tip or suggestion, please let me know! üòä"

944,euu194,Any tips on getting out of a wine club...?,wine,"Also posted in /r/legaladvice, but I suspect you guys will have some interesting answers. :) 

I recently moved and joined a wine club through a local shop: every quarter there's a club event with food/drinks and you pick out your wine from multiple local wineries. If you do not attend the event, you get assigned wine from whatever is left over and you pick it up/it's shipped.

My job has unexpectedly involved a lot of travel lately, and I would like to bow out of the club*. I responded to their most recent email - an invitation to the next member event - letting them know I can't attend due to work, and in light of my new job could I please cancel my subscription and hopefully rejoin in the summer when travel will have subsided? I was told ""we can let you skip this one event, but our wine club membership is for one year."" 

If I'm stuck in this club I'll live, of course. But has anyone else successfully extricated themselves from a club...and how? 

*In the event it's important, reasons include: I've missed previous wine club event since joining due to work-related travel for a new job and the event itself was my main reason for joining - so I could make local friends!, my fiance decided to stop drinking wine which makes a club less economical/fun...and frankly, I am not very impressed with the wines they have chosen for me."

In the past I'd tried to enjoy wine but whenever I tried it, my face scrunched up like a baby trying lemon for the first time. I was sure that I read that if that was the case I should try a sweeter wine, so I got gradually sweeter until I was at port. It was still the same problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I did a bit more research this past week and found it likely wasn't the sweetness but the acidity and tartness I was finding unbearable. So I looked in to Merlot. Definitely a marked improvement but I am not sure if it's something I just need to get used to or whether there are practical options for a lower acid red wine type.

&amp;#x200B;

Utterly exceptional glass, head and shoulders above the Zalto Universal, and hands down the best beer glass I've ever used- just does incredible things to the mouthfeel.

Wasn't going to be possible to replace it (sent to NZ from mother in law in Germany) so I thought repair was worth a go.

Wasn't expecting this to work even vaguely well, it just seemed like a shitty thing ppl do for instagram likes and then toss the glass cos it's actually all wobbly and useless. Buuuuut, I have to say, as ghetto as it might look, I am pretty impressed with the 'jam it into a cork' strategy. Possibly more effective on finer/lighter glassware, than on the chunkier stuff, I suspect. This has been through the dishwasher a coupla times, and while the cork has expanded, its integrity is unchanged.

Yes, it's a bit wobbly, no I didn't get it quite straight, but that's OK! It LIVES ON.

Used a composite cork (partly as that's what was still lying on the table, partly cos I thought the resinous nature could provide better stability) but I'll def do this again next time I break summin, and try natural cork for comparison.

It's a [Mark Thomas](http://www.markthomas.at/) Double Bend Allround.

I passed my Intro exam back in 2017. Life has happened since including a new baby, a couple of job changes and more. I feel finally able to double down on my study for the certified exam in July. I have 7 years of experience serving wine, so I'm not too worried about the mechanics. But what keeps me up at night is the tasting and especially the broad knowledge expected in the certified. 

I'm working on developing a tasting group in my area of Southern Utah, but it seems that the most regular groups will be in Las Vegas- two hours away. I'll make the travel if necessary so as to work at developing my palate further?

Does anyone have any pointers with regards to study materials, flashcards, and more importantly a regimen that worked for you? I've read plenty of books and study materials, but I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels. How can I make my study for fruitful and efficient?

I am extremely grateful for anyone who takes the time to help a fellow wine geek out.

I'm going to start going to a more local shop where I can talk directly to the owner about specific bottles, but even still, what are people's thoughts on buying wine that's more than just 2, 3, 4 years old at a big box retailer? I know Total Wine gets a bit of a bad rap, and locally in Dallas, TX we also have Goody Goody (it's at least only a north Texas chain, not a national one). But anyway, how do we know when a specific bottle was actually released? How long as that store had it? If it's a 2015 released in 2017, have they just had it for 3 years? Stored at room temperature?? I hope not... (As an aside, what's generally the most common amount of time for a winery to bottle age, i.e. time between harvest, barrel, bottle, and release). I've seen things like a 2012 Barolo going for about $40 and I just couldn't bring myself to buy it. I can't imagine that winery held onto that bottle more than 2-3 years, meaning it had potentially been outside of proper storage for 3-4 years (this was in 2019). 

My wife just bought me a bottle of **Maison Denuziere Cote Rotie Les Hauts Lieux 2015** from Total Wine for my birthday and I am ***psyched*** about it. I just can't help but be worried about how long TW may have had it, was it stored in any decent way, etc."
1057,es92rt,Advice for making most of Tuscany with 2 days in Florence?,wine,"Several questions regarding **where to go** and **how to get there** with regards to Tuscany and the wine regions:

**Background**: Traveling as two 20 something year olds with lots of travel/food/wine experience but not a huge budget for this short trip. Of note, I'm not really into touristy vineyards but would appreciate more of an agriturismo/local/organic/artisan food type vibe + outstanding wineries who care a lot about their product (but not necessarily top international names).  Because of this, I'm apprehensive to book day trip tours on Viator etc. We're staying in Florence because we've already been and done the tourist attractions but are trying to train around Italy to fit in odds and ends.

**Where to go/tour recommendations?:** Would obviously prefer to not have to drive since we're on limited time and don't want the hassle, but would like as relaxing and pleasant/high value of an experience as we can (&lt;$200 each?). We're right now most likely going to be based in Florence, and would like some guidance on spending one full day in wine country. Not sure if people would recommend Chianti (it seems somewhat touristy but obviously more convenient), but I do have familiarity with Montepulciano and Brunello wines and enjoy them.

Also any Florence food/shop/eatery/fine goods recs would be appreciated, thanks!

To start we had a cocktail each - she had vodka with yuzu and I had a Negroni, followed by a bottle of Ruinart with Caviar, three different kinds of Oysters (from light and aromatic to rich and creamy) then squid neck. I begun choosing the red, wanting to leave it open for at least 2 hours. I originally picked a 2010 Clape Cornas but alas they were sold out. So I opted for a 2012 Luciano Sandrone Le Vigne. I have had these on release, though never with some age to them.

We then ordered two steaks, both dry aged for 36 months. One was a fillet and other rib eye on the bone, with sides. Then came the wine.

Far out what a wine - after 2 hours decanting this showed off in a big way: plums, fresh mint, orange slices, mixed herbs, fine tannin, acidity in check and long length in the every sip. Perfect with the steaks.So much feeling and joy from a top producer such as this. A 9.5/10 for me.

Finished on dessert with a glass of Kraacher, and I tipped our waiter and Somm a glass each of the red - they were happy, and so were we!

3. Wine-cradles / Don't stand 
4. Suck it up and buy an extra fridge.

Standing at room temp isn't viable here as it gets way too hot for most of the year to let the stand for that long.

Wine-fridge space is doable, but frustrating as cuts down on options I can store at home and has me fighting my offsite too much. On the plus side as long as I don't stand too much I might have room for the decanter in the fridge.

Cradles tend to cause more waste and can be fiddly especially if slow-oxing."

&amp;#x200B;

After having enjoyed a regular red burgundy from 2017 and a C√¥te de Nuits-Villages from 2012 I'd like to try either a great village wine (maybe Fixin or Vosne-Roman√©e?) or a premier cru from the C√¥te de Nuits. While it was easy to find a good quality regular red burg and a good C√¥te de Nuits-Villages, I have no idea what to look for in a high-quality village wine or a premier cru. 

Are Vivino ratings an improtant thing to look for and should I buy something online with a high rating or should I walk into my local wine store and ask them to help me pick a bottle? Are vintages very important and should I skip 2013 or isn't it that important?

I've also heard that one of the main things that distinguishes good red burgundy wines is the ability to improve over age, so should I only look for older vintages or will newer ones also be worth the money?

And one last question, in what way do young premier cru wines differ from young village ones? Is it just an improvement of the wine's balance of flavours or is there also added complexity (even though both wines are young)?

Some producers that I have access to include Drouhin, Domaine Robert Sirugue, Domaine Huguenot, Domaine Chopin, JC Boisset and Vougeraie (but I could also try find some Meo Camuzet online).

I'd appreciate some advice since I have no idea what to look for :-)"

Mind you, I drank plenty of amazing ""red label"" and ‚Äúblue label‚Äù Rioja in Spain, and they've always been a treat, but when they wanted to share their ""best stuff,"" in almost every instance they reached for something with a green label, meaning it did not qualify as one of the typical classifications. They often used different oak, or less oak, or, in one case, aged it in amphora. Alternatively, they showcased some of their eccentric younger wines, ones that were complex but exhibited a much more fruit-forward experience than the typical Rioja. One winemaker summed it up like this: drinking a gran reserva is like listening to Frank Sinatra, drinking this (green label wine) is like listening to Frank Ocean. One is classic, one is new-age, both have merits.

I also like the De Bortoli Cuv√©e Blanc for its relative price compared to its quality. It‚Äôs not a perfect, or even a great sparkling wine, but it‚Äôs $17 and you won‚Äôt see much that‚Äôs anything near the same quality at that price in Australia. The Stonier Pinot ($20 IIRC) is lovely as well but it‚Äôs for those who prefer the more subtle, watery type of pinot‚ÄîI like the translucent feel but for those who like stronger tastes it could seem a bit dilute. The Turkey Flat Ros√© is pretty lovely as well, it‚Äôs a cliche by now though.

I‚Äôd love to hear from others who have tried a couple of different wines and formed some sort of view. Also interested to hear about some more expensive wines (as in $40-100) because I don‚Äôt have the chance to taste them generally, but if there‚Äôs one that‚Äôs very well-regarded enough I could justify putting a bit extra towards them.

Edit: is there any person who can recommend specifically a sweet Australian sparkling wine? (As in the non-Champagne equivalent to demi-sec/semi-dry.) I don‚Äôt care about the price."

I spend pretty much all I can afford keeping up with what I already know I like, so I'm not looking for a new way to spend thousands of dollars, but I'd at least like to get a handful of bottles as a sampling to have a better idea what decent to good Burgundy (Pinot) is like. Maybe two or three bottles each of entry level, Villages, and 1er cru (maybe even one or two grand cru though not sure if I'm looking to spend that much right away) to have something to drink sooner and something to cellar for a while. But I have no idea what I'm looking for and have had a much more difficult time making sense of subregions and producers than with other regions.

I prefer 'old school'/traditional reds with less oak, ripeness, alcohol, and extraction and more structure, terroir, and elegance. Rustic/brett is totally fine. Any help figuring out which producers might be up my alley, or particular bottles to look for, would be great. Especially anything that I can actually buy right away (I've done most of my shopping through online retailers because local selection is pretty bad and prices are fairly high--I live in Tennessee)."

I‚Äôve been in wine and spirits sales for the past 5 years. And have been on the distribution side for about 3 years.  And this might be a bit of a pipe dream, but it‚Äôs at least something I‚Äôm thinking about further down the road. 

I‚Äôve got a lot of questions and I‚Äôd appreciate any responses you‚Äôre willing to give. Or if you want to DM that works too. 



How did you start in the wine business?


Do you import and distribute to on/off premise or import and supply distributors?


Did/does your business have a central theme or focus(other than making money) - such as a focus on Loire/Burgundy/piedmont/natural etc. 


Did you start with a group of producers from one region or several regions/countries?


What is something you wish you had known or started early in the life of the business?


What was your biggest challenge besides selling all of your products?


How prohibitive was governmental red tape?


How difficult was it to find proper shipping partners?


How long after starting was your company profitable?


Did you start with multiple employees or just yourself?



Again I appreciate your time and any responses you‚Äôre willing to share.

Whatsapp from a Senior Sommelier of 10 years at hatted/michelin restaurants for when you are out, or needing a buying recommendation - but no Sommelier is around, or the waitstaff/bottle shop staff don't know.",wine,"[https://askthesomm.carrd.co/](https://askthesomm.carrd.co/)  


Hi there,   


My name is Aaron, as my thread title says I am a Senior Sommelier of 10 years, and 7 months ago became a Dad, so I moved into IT during the day to be home of an evening - though I still love wine and still wanted to be a part of it somehow. I always get asked at work for wine recommendations, and being a guest myself at different places of late I was left disappointed by the service - so I believe strongly there is room in the world for something like this.  


Way it works is simple - you message me on Whatsapp where you are eating (if outside of Australia, please provide state/country), what you mainly plan to eat, style of wine you want (bubbly, white, red? Sweet, dry, light, full?) and price range approx - then leave the rest to me! I look up the menu online, and if not available, I'll ask for a photo of the wine page that interests you.  


As this is a new idea, it is currently free to use. If you do use it, would appreciate if you share this with your friends and any feedback.   


Important to note I am from Australia, so if you are from a different timezone to me (like EU/US) then there will be a delay in me getting back to you - so thanks for waiting and I will get back asap.

Then book a seat at the window front and make sure you travel during the day (when there is light) -- the train travels directly through the Rhine valley and passes all those beautiful spots like the Loreley, a hundred castles and ALL of the vineyards on the surrounding steep hills. A great experience that never get's old and is so cheap that you have more money left for the lots of good wine you want to take home with you ;)
Hope someone will try! :)"

2013 Blanc - Surely one of the best whites to come from Bordeaux. So refreshing with this tropical lime, white flowers and fresh cream profile, fine acidity and length. Vanished quickly.   


We didn't taste these in any particular order - just poured out and tried side by side to each other.   


1998 - Creme brulee, white flowers, apricot, pineapple. Medium bodied and not rich like other vintages. Super complex. Big tick for me, my kind of Sauternes.   


2005 - Wild nose. Honey, almond, pear juice. Again, the complexity will slow you down drinking this in the best way possible. A lighter tasting style again. Very good.   


1987 - Orange, flowers, some herbal vibes - pretty straight forward. It was okay, didn't really excite me.   


My overall pick of the evening? The Blanc!

He's an advanced wine connoisseur, but I am not.  Could you help me with what to get him?  Unfortunately, I don't know what he likes, but I'm going to take a conservative approach and say Old World over New World.

Also, I've been introduced to the idea of a horizontal wine tasting, and I think this would be a fun way to get him a few good wines rather than one expensive wine.

I am budgeting $100-200 for this.

I‚Äôm trying to expand my horizon and would therefore like some recommendations of your favorite wines in the $20-$50 range (USD) which you would recommend. I‚Äôm pretty open to anything so any style or varietal is welcome. I know that the Wine Bible provides some suggestions on producers for each region, so that may be a resource to look into; however, I think an open discussion of this form would be quite interesting.

Perhaps we could also expand the sidebar for $20-$50, $50-$100, $100-$250, $250-$500, to have a permanent resource, although that‚Äôs quite ambitious.

To start off (and quite commonly known):

Lopez de Heredia Tondonia is a great sub $50 wine which has beautiful structure, flavour, with quite significant age for its price.

EDIT:

I'm going to start compiling these suggestions by region with prices, probably won‚Äôt get to it until tomorrow. Thanks!"

Long time lurker, first time poster - need some advice.

My wedding is coming up in early April, and I wanted to provide all our wedding guests with something bubbly upon their arrival (~20 bottles). After Christmas, our local wine shop had an excellent sale, and I decided to jump on a few bottles of a sparkling white perfect for spring. (I‚Äôd have preferred champagne, but it is what it is. I needed 20 bottles of the same kind, this is what they had.)

Now I have to store them until early April. I have a wine fridge, but it isn‚Äôt big enough for all 20 bottles.

I‚Äôve also read conflicting advice as to whether sparkling wine should be stored horizontally or vertically, and the fact that it‚Äôs just a few months seems to matter as well.

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for two different meals picked by my companion.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Broccoli Cottage ""Cannelloni"". Recipe: https://divaliciousrecipes.com/broccoli-ricotta-cannelloni/ . We will use cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

The second is a Cauliflower Pork Fried Rice. Recipe: https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/cauliflower-pork-fried-rice/

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

I do have a couple of wines that should go sooner rather than later - but unsure if these would make good pairings with these dishes. The estimated drink-by date are underneath. 
In addition, I also have a Repour'ed  2005 Domaine G. Roumier Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras and 2015 G√©rard Bertrand Pinot Gris Blanc	 Pays d'Oc. Finally, a 2008 Guti√©rrez Colosia, Oloroso Sherry is also an option because somebody told me I should drink that one sooner rather than later

We plan to take the train from Porto to Ferr√£o, where Quinta Nova is (our accommodations). We don't want to take a car so we can imbibe.

1. We want to take a boat tour to sightsee. Quinta Nova offers one from Ferr√£o to Pinh√£o. Is this stretch particularly beautiful? Or should we look for a boat tour that goes from Pinh√£o eastward? If the latter, any recommendations for an operator?

2. Then we plan to go to dinner at DOC. It is on the other side of the river from Quinta Nova, so we are thinking to take the train from Ferrao to Covelinhas and cross there by boat to Folgosa. Has anyone done this? Then we to take a taxi/hired driver home. Is it possible to find a taxi at DOC, or should we pre-arrange?

3. For our second day, we would love to bop around winery to winery, but it seems like it is going to be extremely pricey to hire a private driver and that nearly all tours start/end in Porto. We are thinking of just go to Pinh√£o and doing a few near there by walking/taxi (Bomfim, Seixo, and la Rosa). Are we making a mistake by doing this? Will it be overrun with tourists?

After months of emails and phone calls for wine orders and recommendations for dinners they would have, I got invited over as this persons Housekeeper wanted my opinion on their cellar. I would spend the next few days creating a spreadsheet of everything they had - stuff to drink now, throw out and keep with recommended drinking windows. It was an extensive list that went into the hundreds of items and would take me a month to finish properly with researching bottles. I sent the spreadsheet off and didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a fortnight. Eventually the housekeeper got back to me and couldn‚Äôt believe the data within it, and asked to send an invoice. I replied back it was no charge (they were already spending crazy amounts for dinner parties and gifts). I didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a week and got invited over to theirs again for coffee and lunch - and that‚Äôs when this wine came out. It would be the first of a number of crazy ones I had only ever read about, yet here I was now having them at this persons house. For lunch, it was some ham and salad rolls! The wine of course is what you would expect from such a name and vintage and perfectly cellared - powerful, fresh blue fruit still present with a deep blue jam flavour, graphite and a smoked wood flavour. The finish lasted minutes. Crazy wine.

Unfortunately we couldn't see everything and stuck pretty close to Solvang, Los Olivos, and downtown Santa Barbara. 

Quick favorites in case someone wants a future recommendation: Grassini (!!), Brick Barn, Sanger, Rideau. 

All said we did about 15 tastings (plus russian river and lagunitas) and I brought home about a case and a half of wine. Between this trip and holidays, I opened a bottle of wine almost every day in December. Looking forward to a well needed diet and dry-out this month."

I guess this has been asked a few times on /r/wine before, but I'm still not sure so I thought I'd ask again!

&amp;#x200B;

I don't work in wine, but am an enthusiast and have learnt quite a lot from reading online (Jancis Robinson / Wikipedia). I also have done a beginner's winetasting course, which was great fun. 

I recently got myself the study book for WSET Level 2 and have read most of it - I learnt a lot from the winemaking section, but would say I was already pretty familiar with the different grape varieties / standard regions.

I'd like to take a WSET course (onsite at their school in London), but I'm not sure if I should go for Level 2 or Level 3. Level 3 seems like it would be more interesting, and I'd learn a lot more. (I'm also pretty confident I could pass the Level 2 exam right now.) But from reading on here it seems like there's a huge jump between Level 2 and Level 3, and I'm not sure if I'll have enough tasting experience to get enough out of Level 3, or if it'll just be too difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on what I should go for / how to work out if Level 3 would be out of my reach?"

In 2019, I went with my wife to St. Petersburg, and we watched 'The Swan Lake' at the St. Petersburg Ballet Theatre (http://www.spbt.ru/). There, she had a red wine and later regretted not writing down its name. We went through the pictures, and the only one I could find that had the label was this one, but I couldn't make the name (Gustav? Gustavo? Something like that?). I tried searching for these names on google, but couldn't find one with a similar label.

Anyway, can you guys help me figure out the label of this red wine, and where I may get it in europe? I appreciate it very, very much! Thanks a million in advance!

I'm relatively new to wine, and I've been shopping in the $15-$20 price range, which seems to be a reasonable area for drinking 1-2 bottles a month, as I do. However, I'm a little intimidated by going into wine shops and being faced with big selections of seemingly-identical (to my uneducated eye) products.

I'm curious what you guys look for on the bottle to help you make a decision, especially when there are multiple bottles that appear similar on the surface, but have different price points (for example, I just did a quick search online for 2015 Barbera d'Albas from Piedmont, and found 8 different bottles ranging from $12 to $38). Are there any big red flags that would steer you away from a particular bottle (like brands that are well-known to be subpar)?

I'm used to shopping in the Scotch/Rum space, were I can look at information like age, cask type, origin (for Rum especially), or ABV to make a decision; I just haven't built up that ""vocabulary"" for wine yet.

Additionally - are there any good blogs/websites/YouTube channels/podcasts that help you stay up to date with the current wine market?"

Hi! I work at a liquor store in sw Missouri! I love my job, as it works really well with my school schedule. I am probably the most knowledgeable person there on beer, and most people defer questions and phone calls to me on the topic. So its definitely safe to say that beer is my wheel house. I do love wine, but I'm learning. I dont know nearly as much as my coworkers do about it.

Some work drama happened and the wine managers position was dissolved and she quit. I mentioned a few months ago that I would really like to round myself out and work in the wine room so I can learn! My boss took that, and decided that I should run the wine room! So here I am, a total beer guy... with his own wine room... 

Now before you jump the gun, I've read the FAQ and the beginners guide so I do have what I think is a minimum base knowledge about wine. But what I'm here today for is... help, honestly. 

I havent tasted much wine and I dont have the budget to just buy a bunch right now. I'm also just not really familiar with how to help potential customers. In my beer section, I've had most of what people ask about, so helping is usually pretty easy. But if someone were to ask me the differences between different sav' blancs, I know that I would just be a bumbling idiot. 

I know some of you will say ""just do your best and try stuff and make your own opinions as you go!"", which I will absolutely be doing! But I just need some help. 

Tell me your opinions on wines! Tell me your hot takes! Tell me what gets your goat about this one winery! Tell me what I might expect from some of my customers and how I can sort of bullshit some of my way though this period! Anything from anyone is going to be a huge help! So please dont be afraid! 

Edit: spelling

* Drink and swirl around mouth 

* for each sip I focus on one thing e.g. Acidity, body, length etc and jot down what I notice. 

* I then jot down an overall review of what I actually thought (e.g. bit tart for my liking but might go well with food etc).

* Give it another smell and taste as I often find I smell things I didn't catch before after a short break (or it's just oxidized properly because I'm impatient)

From this list, but I can choose outside it, have 200 bottles, I'd pick the 2010 Vi√±a William F√®vre Carm√©n√®re La Misi√≥n Reserva or 2013 Casa Silva Carm√©n√®re Santa Tierra Estate with the meatloaf. For the others, I'd be less sure. Especially the Tofu Spinach Palak Paneer is an odd duck.  One of the reasons I'd like to ask advice to the experienced folk in this sub :-)

I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season, and welcome to the January installment of the Monthly Wine Challenge! Thanks to some wonderful dialogue in the last couple of months, I felt that with the new year, it is time to try something new for the MWC.  For the most part, there won't be much of a difference.  I'm still going to hold to the format of region and grape.  But I'm also going to switch it up from time to time, and I'm hoping that this will stop the stagnation that has been plaguing us lately.  I'm going to be calling this the Experimental Series, inspired by a series of scotch that my dad has from the Glenfiddich distillery.  And with that, there is no time like the present.  So, with that  in mind, lets discover what this month has in store for us:  


**Grape:** Pinot Noir  
**Country and Region #1:** USA, Pacific North West  
**Country and Region #2:** New Zealand, Any  


Thats right!  Not one, but TWO regions this month!  I've always wanted to try to include comparative tastings to the MWC, but until now, I was unsure how to do it.  So, for the first entry into the MWC Experimental Series, I have decided on pinot noir from the PNW of the US, with one from anywhere in New Zealand.  As I am not very familiar with either region, I felt this was a good place to start.  Feel free to post notes for multiple bottles.  If you have 2 from one region and one from another, go ahead!  Can only find one region, and not the other, thats ok to.  Just post what notes you have.  Otherwise, the format will not be much different from previous challenges.    


So, just like with past MWC entries, us on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.), and e) if you preferred one style over the other.

If you are new to wine tasting, [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/2015/08/25/how-to-taste-wine/) has a great article to get you going.  Have fun choosing your wine, and I will see you all on the 15th!

See you on the 15th!  If you have suggestions for future comparative tastings, or just a suggestion for one of our regular tastings, please feel free to message me.  And as a reminder, if you have not posted your notes from the December 2019 Challenge, you will be able to do so in this thread until January 7th."
1456,ej392b,Suggestion for a wine.,wine,"I'm very unfamiliar with wine, but I decided recently on a future gift for my nieces that were recently born: I want to buy them each a bottle of wine to age at home until they either marry or turn 30 (whichever occurs first).

I've been trying to do some research in regards to good wines that can be aged about 30 years but thus far, the only suggestion I've found is to not buy something that costs less than $25.

I'd like some suggestions for what wines I should consider for this and what the wines are like. Thank you!"

My wife told me to pick a wine class I wanted to attend as a Christmas present.  Having read a lot and knowing what I""m good at (acidity, alcohol, identifying oak, earth aromas, and general wine knowledge) and what I'm bad at (fruit aromas and floral aromas), I was wondering if a wine aroma kit might be a better investment.

I'm good at identifying oak and general wine structure, but more than a little embarrassed, that I don't get raspberry rather than just ""general fruit"".  I can get barnyard, earthy, mushroom, but rose vs. marigold or strawberry vs blackberry and I'm just guessing.  Weird thing is, I taste a lot better than I smell.  Okay, that sounded bad . . . uh, my sense of taste of those things is much better than me trying to smell them before drinking.

I've read good things about Le Nez du Vin, but man that's expensive ($400).  I thought about doing my own, but I have a lot of other time commitments.  So a kit is probably worth it.  Maybe?

What are your all's thoughts on courses versus the aroma kits?  Anybody done the WSET2 or 3 stuff?  Recommend an aroma kit?

Thanks."

 Overall, I think this would make a stellar gift for someone that likes Champagne.   This is the third bottle of LP Cuvee Rose I have enjoyed this year.  I picked them all up for $17 each on a grocery store clearance deal... which is really impossible to beat.

Since then we've been a little better off financially and I just got a new job.  I'd like to surprise her with a bottle but can't remember the name of it.  I know it was red, and I think it was from France.  It had some colorful circles on the label on what I think is a white background.

1511,ei5di0,I've had the fortunate pleasure of drinking some amazing wines these past few years. How can I learn to enjoy and appreciate them more?,wine,"First post in here, hoping this is a good place for the question. 

For some background, I never drank wine until meeting my current fiancee. Her family is big on wine, mine liquor. My new father in law in particular is a huge wine connoisseur. Every time we're together we're opening mostly $75+ bottles. 

My fiancee and I are now in Oregon and have obviously discovered the point noir. But our budget is more $10-15 bottles. Every time the in laws are in town we're going to the best wineries or wine bars. Spent yesterday tasting at beaux freres and Bergstrom and came home with a few cases gifted to us as well. This is pretty typical. 

So my question I guess. I've been fortunate to try enough amazing wines that i can enjoy it and tell when I'm drinking a really nice wine. But i don't have much of a defined palette for it and wish i could appreciate more or say more than just ""wow this is good"". I've been to a number of great tastings.

1523,ehmgwv,Question about returning flawed bottle,wine,"I would like some advice from restaurant professionals on how I could have better handled a situation I was in last night. I was out to dinner at a moderately upscale restaurant with like 12 people last night and ordered a bottle of 2016 ridge zin for myself. The wine was obviously flawed, cooked, had no fresh fruit, smelled like off prunes. Overall palate was thin and unappetizing. As to not cause a scene and get chastised by my non wine drinking extended family I took my glass to the bar to get his opinion and get a new bottle. He smelled it and thought it was port before I even told him what wine I had ordered. The waitress comes to the table and takes the bottle and returns with a decanter filled with a ‚Äúnew‚Äù ridge zin. This time I try it and it either has the same flaw or is the same wine since I never saw her open the new bottle. I shrugged it off again as to not be called picky or something by my family. I should have probably complained but just let it go. Was I justified in returning the bottle? And how could I have handled it differently? Seems like bad practice to return with a new wine in a decanter.

Update: I called and spoke with the manager and he agreed it was wrong of the server to bring the new wine decanted and not open it in front of me. He also said he‚Äôs gonna pop another bottle open to see if the others are also flawed. Issued a full refund for the wine and was very nice and respectful."

I feel like the winners are generally the same, I just can't seem to win!

Previous competition winners are as follows

1. Cooper and Theif blend
2. Juggernaut cab
3. Bogle Phantom
4. Napa Valley
5. Stratton Lumis Petite Syrah

I really need some help as I don't try a lot of wines.  Common characteristics above are big, bold, bone dry, oaky, high tannins, acidic.

&amp;#x200B;

I entered a 2009 raymond reserve last year and got my butt kicked.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year someone suggested Priorat or Tether Napa Valley.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 

Results are in!

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bogle Phantom, by a long shot, it destroyed everything in every category
2. La Storia Cab (2017) - it was very good but lacked the oaky notes from phantom.
3. Rodney Strong Alexander Valley Cab (2015)
4. Owen's Vineyard Cab 2015
5. 1000 stories gold rush red (2017) - my entrance. Another competition and another loss!

This may be a silly question I know but I'm just wondering what most folks actually do and if the dual zone is worth it.

My question is already in the title. Aleatico is usually a grape used for passito style wines. I have come across some producers in my researcg, usually in Sonoma, who make a rose out of Aleatico. But I'm wondering if anyone has had a dry still red wine made from Aleatico and what the aromas and flavors are?

I'm a winemaker and have been trying to find very aromatic red grapes that has significant rose aromas as a descriptor. I know nebbiolo is one but it doesn't reach the same heights as it does in Italy.

Nose: Immensely dense and compley. At first, loads of red and dark fruit. Ripe cherries, blackberries, plums, blueberries.. Then, with swirling, olives, laurel berry leaves, tobacco and leather. I spent over 10 minutes with just sniffing.

Palate: It's like a fruit tsunami overwhelming yor. Needs some time to identify all the aromes, because there are so many. Everyhing I got in the nose is also present on the palate, with a great clarity and precision. It's like looking on the many facings of a diamond that changes its appearens when you turn it around in the light. The acidity and density is amazing, the 15,5% feel like 13,5%. The wine is at the same time overwhelming and elegant. The finish is basically endless, adding on the primary notes salty caramel, leather, burnt almonds, cinnamon and eucalyptus. Despite the complexity it screams for the next sip.

Score: 97/100, I agree with the high parker scores on this winery.

On top, it's really affordable, I payd around 60‚Ç¨ three years ago. The only wine that I rated higher this year was 2016 Figeac, which sells for around 250‚Ç¨ at the moment."

The problem is that I'm not sure what quantity to buy.
In my experience the wine industry is infamous for price not correlating with quality. I've had some very expensive bottles of decent wine and some affordable bottles of fantastic wine. That definitely does not help me. With Brandy/whisky/rum I can easily pinpoint if it's a ‚Ç¨20, ‚Ç¨40, or ‚Ç¨80 bottle because the complexity and the smoothness is right there on your tongue. With wine I have no clue.




Do I buy two ‚Ç¨50 bottles, three ‚Ç¨40, or 5 ‚Ç¨20 bottles?
I definitely don't want to buy just one bottle but I don't know how many quality bottles I can get before it's definitely not great wines.

HOWEVER, there might be an exception to this. In South Australia, the weather gets hot and it is the least mountainous of the major viticultural regions. Florida's Sugarloaf mountain seems to resemble some of this geography. Perhaps this should be a descent place to grow Shiraz in the American southeast, since Shiraz loves high alcohol content and high alcohol is a result of heat.  


That being said, this can only be done on a cold year. Florida used to have cool winters, but climate change has shifted this in recent years.

Its litteraly just the fanciest darn shot glass I have ever seen in my life. Like the fuck'n thing actually held less then an ounce, and had a 3 inch neck like a normal wine glass.

1594,egmtw4,Weird experience with Riesling,wine,"Sorry if this isn‚Äôt a normal post for this sub, but my SO and I are dying to solve this. 

My SO (we‚Äôll call her Oli) and I were at a super nice restaurant in Denver and while we‚Äôve both had a fair share of wine, we had never had Riesling before. She decided to give it a shot and ordered a glass of belle pente Riesling from willamette valley 2009. At first, the wine was fantastic! It was very sweet and smooth and encouraged me to order a glass. 

But after this first sip is when we became completely lost in what was going on. 

Oli noticed something in her glass (small piece of sweater lint maybe) and pulled it out with her knife.  She wasn‚Äôt worried about whatever it was and didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss. But, after taking whatever it was out, the wine took on a completely new flavor. A new strangely acidic/chemical taste completely overpowered the wines original flavor. 

This obviously spurred her to order a new glass, with our best theory being the metal of the knife effected the flavor in some way we were too unknowledgeable to understand. My glass arrived with her new one, and thus our confusion continued to pile up. 

Both of our glasses had this weird new flavor that the original sip did not have in any way. At a complete loss, we googled Riesling to make sure we weren‚Äôt being dumb about the experience of really nice wines. What we found on google was this as the top result: ‚ÄúRiesling is a white grape variety which originated in the Rhine region. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines.‚Äù - from Wikipedia

So here‚Äôs my question for you wine aficionados here on r/wine, are we uncultured in wines (especially nicer ones like Riesling) or did we have an experience that is clearly not what is supposed to happen?

TLDR: SO and I got Riesling for the first time and have no clue if we were poisoned or just uncultured in Riesling."

My current wine key has a finely serrated foil cutter and it just doesn't cut quite like when I first got it.  I watched a few videos just now that people from here linked and the guys cut the foil in two straight cuts.  I'm over here sawing at it for like 45 seconds.  Is there anything I can do to sharpen it?  The flat side was starting to roll over so I took it to a whetstone and that helped a little.  Could it be a technique thing?  I noticed from the videos that I'm doing everything else right, and if I had a sharper knife I wouldn't be sawing at it.  When I try doing two quick cuts like in the videos the blade doesn't cut all of the way through the foil, so removing it is sloppy unless I go back around.

1605,egde90,Your Favorite Great Value Burgundies,wine,"In light of the wonderful tasting notes that have been showing up recently, I thought it would be nice to collectively share and discuss some of our favorite values in Burgundy. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts!


Some of my favorite values are:

White:


-PYCM Bourgogne Blanc: A rather well-made wine and an excellent introduction to the house style. His Pernand-Vergelesses wines also punch well above their weight and can sometimes be found under $50. I feel that PYCM's wines are a good example of the importance of winemaking and terroir; though with the lesser wines you miss out on the terroir, his signature is still there (and I happen to love it).


Red:


-Hudelot-No√´llat Bourgogne Rouge: A beautiful introduction to red burgundy, all red-fruited elegance and grace. While lacking some depth, it's simply a delicious wine -- another example where I just love the style.


Also, recently I tried a 2016 Domaine Bart Marsannay and was not expecting much -- it was a producer I had never heard of from a lesser village. However, this wine really outperformed. At first a bit closed, but this opened up to reveal a deeply dark-fruited wine with striking purity. A strong mineral backbone and streak of acidity along with a tight tannic structure implies that this will benefit from some cellar time. Was really impressed by this wine."

I was always set on buying the bible as my second book, but from what I read here, the OWC beats any book when it comes to how much info it contains. I have the pdf of the bible (just to check the contents, not using or sharing it) and the layout seems to be largely the same as wine folly, but with more detail: introductory chapter about what wine is and how its made, followed by info about the big wine regions. The way I use wine folly right now, it seems like I use the books more as reference books rather than reading them cover to cover.

I checked the contents of OWC on google books and I got confused. I couldn't see all pages of course but most of the visible pages were just some sort of index.

TLDR: My question is: Could someone who owns the OWC tell me what the contents are and how it is build up?"

It was so thick that we decided it was probably a defective bottle. However I remember really enjoying it. I haven‚Äôt ever had a wine that full bodied.

Normally I'd assume that it was a problem with aging or the bottle, but I find this to be universally true of wines even with perfect provenance, including wines from very nice restaurants with very high price tags (expensive FG Bordeaux from Michelin starred places).

1630,efw6jf,I'm looking for the perfect gift for my father.,wine,"First of all, this is my first post in this subreddit, I love how there's such a nice community for something so old and wonderful as wine. Now, I need a piece of advice from you. I'm a young Spanish guy that discovered some month ago that his father ""secretly"" started a rather curious collection.

My father wants to collect (Football-cards-album style) the ""stickers"" (front and back labels on the bottle) of each one of Spanish wine designations of origin, let me explain: in Spain there are a certain number of certificated wine producers, each one of them with their own ""Name"", ""Brand"" and designation of origin that they share with other wine producers of the same region.

And the thing is, that my father wants at least one of those bottles to add to it's collection, Imagine that in the region of MADRID there are 2 designations of origin with 6 different wine producers, so my father need 2 bottles, one for each designation of origin of the region of MADRID. You can find more and better information about this in this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_wine_regions) webpage.

Now, what's the problem? I have no idea what to do.

I would like to help my father to complete his collection with a nice gift (I have to add the fact that in Spain we have another Christmas-gifts-and-presents-situation on January 6th, more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi)). Here are some of my first ideas:

I have been thinking about buying a bottle from one of the 2 archipelagos of Spain: Balearic and Canary Islands, it's seems like those islands have their own designations of origin that are very hard to find in the Spanish peninsula (where we live), so I think it would be a nice present, the thing is that I have no idea which should I pick.

Also, while looking through Amazon I discovered the concept of ""Submarine Wines"" that it seems like it's quite a thing in Spain. The bottles looks so cool and unique with all the sea stuff attached to it, here is an [example](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07KVJQYT6/ref=sspa_dk_detail_2?psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWkFWQjRGT0pZNFdTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjkzNDgzWU02Q0ZYSkdRSEpJJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzNDkyOTgzTFZSUDM5QlRIWjlNJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsMiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) .

And my last thought was trying to look for any kind of accessory or tool that would help my father get the stickers from the bottle. I did a bit of detective work while he was sleeping and I have been taking some pictures of how it's he doing it. It's seems like he submerges the bottles in just water for a couple of days, then with a razor blade he extract the stickers, with the little glue left in the stickers it paste them in some kitchen-super-dry-paper and let them dry for some hours, then he puts them in his folder.

The pictures I took:

https://preview.redd.it/lr75m6b6lz641.jpg?width=1909&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a381bbfdc7e243b65f58301ae709d33966f6b101

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hnjt6ev8lz641.jpg?width=1793&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5113fcd5749a4a23b7cbc182af0299303479372

  

https://preview.redd.it/2ew8xo6blz641.jpg?width=1965&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d5d0972bc7dea2daf084e4a5c54245b7c520459

It's seems like he wants to get more stickers before making any kind of sorting by type, year or designations of origin, by now he's just stacking them together in the folder.

Additional information: My father it's not a crazy wine drinker, he drinks very casually, not everyday. Also, as a lot of you would know wine in Spain is very cheap, we do not live in a mansion or drive expensive cars, the most expensive wine he have bought for the collection was around 21‚Ç¨, being said that I wouldn't mind spending 50‚Ç¨ in a bottle of wine for my father (like the submarine bottle linked before) but more expensive than that... don't think so.

So that's the situation right now, I would like to know your opinion on all of this, what do you think It would be a nice gift for him!

Thank you so much for reading my post! Hope you all have a nice day, Cheers ! Proost ! Sant√© ! Salute ! Kanpai ! Sk√•l ! and Salud !"

Here's my situation: I'm a student that doesn't have place for a wine fridge but would like to be able to safely store wines for the medium term, not more than four months. I'm currently placing my wine in my fridge, which can be set to a maximum of 6 degrees celcius (43 F) and 60% humidity. Is this setting safe to store wine (horizontally so the cork doesn't dry out) for a maximum of four months without experiencing a decrease in quality? The alternative is to store my wine at room temperature, 20 degrees celcius (68 F) in the winter and about 25 (77 F) in summer. 

I've not been able to find minimum temperatures apart from freezing temperatures to store wine at online, only maximum temperatures.

* 2013 Le Bourgogne de Louis Latour Blanc Chardonnay (DBD 2016?)
* 2013 Domaine de la Jasse Vin de Pays d'Oc Barrique Blanc (DBD 2015?)

And we have two dinners planned which I think Chardonnay - or certain types of it - might be well-suited

(1) Chicken Mushroom Tomato Zoodles (Recipe: http://www.perchancetocook.com/2017/01/23/paleo-mushroom-kale-and-spiced-ground-chicken-tomato-sauce-gf/). We'll likely drop or replace the kale.

(2) Yogurt Beet Pumpkin Pizza (Recipe: https://www.blueberryvegan.com/en/winterliche-knusprige-pizzaschiffchen-mit-kuerbis-rote-bete-und-gruenkohl/). Again, we'll likely drop or replace the kale (with spinach?) and perhaps add feta for some added protein/flavour.

So three questions:

1. is a Chardonnay a good choice for these meals?

2. Are my estimated DBDs accurate?

3. Which chardonnay would match best with which dish?"

This morning I found out that optimal storage for Dom Perignon is in a dark cool cellar. The temperature in my living room is 20 degrees Celsius or 68 Fahrenheit. Stupid I know but I am new to Vintage Wine. =/ 

I am kind of freaking out because I am worried this will spoil the Dom Perignon. It has been sitting under the tree for only 2 days and Christmas will come up in 3 days. Can this champagne become noticeably ruined in this timespan? There is some sunlight in the room, though not much and it's still in a box and wrapped under the tree.

What should I do at this point? Should I put it in my garage cabinet? it's about 0 celsius or 32 Fahrenheit there. But I don't want a sudden switch in temp to ruin it.

Please help!

tl;dr can storing a box of Dom Perignon 2008 at 20\*c in a room with not much exposure to sunlight for a few days ruin the bottle??"

I have decided to get into the world of vintage port, a decision largely based on my love for the drink and the relative cheapness of the product. However, in learning about this I fear I may have ruined my first bottle of vintage. 

I purchased a bottle of 2016 Barros in April of this year and have stored it on its side. However, rather than having it in a cool dry place, it has been in my bedroom (I live in the UK) which can be slightly warm over the summer but much cooler in the winter (i.e. now). It is in a box on the bottle of a bookshelf type affair.

My question it, is there a way to tell if this is now ruined and what is my best course of action for the bottle going forward? I know I need to store it for 20 years+ but I just don't know if I should now abandon this particular bottle.

Going forward I will be a lot more careful with the port I purchase."

I have been using my own at my current job since we opened in August.  And to guests, its great!  People ask, ""Ive seen those, but never knew how they worked"" or ""Ive never seen an opener like that."" 

I was showing an employee how to use it a few weeks ago, and she cracked the neck of a bottle.

Yesterday, i chipped the lip of a bottle, and was told i cant use my Ahso anymore.  When thinking about it today, i realized my Ahso was packed in my bag for an offsite tasting, and i used a conventional 2-step corkscrew, and the chip on the bottle was on the outside lip of the bottle (impossible with an ahso)

They're mostly focused on wine in the context of food pairings although drink plenty of wine sans-food. They're pretty excited to expand their general knowledge and are currently struggling a little with pulling out specific flavor notes, but I imagine that comes with time.

Currently they own and use the Wine Folly book and have been hinting that it may be time to 'upgrade' to the Magnum edition. My question is, is there enough content to justify owning both? Are there other books that may be similar, but contain a bit more information?

I've done a bit of searching and the Wine Bible seems to be oft recommended, however seems to be more focused on history, geography and other information about wine as opposed to the act of tasting it.

I saw a recommendation for "" Wine: A Tasting Course: Every Class in a Glass"", which seems to be a step in the right direction but also may be too similar?

I thought about picking up several wines as opposed to information, but they enjoy the shopping experience and chatting with the shop owner, so I'll leave the wine buying to them. Thanks!"

We like wine so ended up at a few places worth mentioning for future posterity. Turns out, wine culture in Spain is just as awesome as you'd expect. And it is very accessible for those without big budgets. 

We didn't do any ""wine touring"" per se -- just drinking glasses at bars, and a few bottles at home along the way. This is more of a post on the places and their wine focus than tasting notes on any wine in particular. 

**Barcelona**

* [La Catalista](https://www.lacatalista.com/) . This was our first stop after arriving in Barcelona. It was raining, our AirBnB host was running late, so we walked 50 steps to the closest bar we could find. We ended up coming back for at least a glass every day for the remainder of our trip. It's a wine bar owned by an American ex-pat serving exclusively Catalan wine along with some seriously good food. Focus is on smaller producers making low-intervention wine, especially with less than common local varieties. My first wine there was an a fun off-dry, oxidative white made with [Malvasia de Sitges](https://i.imgur.com/p1PF4Nf.jpg) that was super delicious. Other memorable bits included this [gran reserve cava with cerviche](https://i.imgur.com/qKiFETE.jpg). (And the sumoll in the background was the first time I'd ever heard of or tried that grape.) An example of their [rotating wild card menu](https://i.imgur.com/czZPfgh.jpg) . Overall just a fun little wine bar with a super friendly staff who likes local, well-made wine. *Whose it for:* Folks who want local wine, but need to talk about it in English

* [Quimet y Quimet](https://www.quimetquimet.com/): Dinner our first night. Yes its busy, yes there are tourists, yes there are locals. They are a bit pushy, but damn was everything we ate tasty. We started with their homemade [vermouth and Quimet y Quimet beer]([https://i.imgur.com/YlC6UoI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YlC6UoI.jpg)) before sharing some cava and a few more appetizers. Nice thing is you can buy [anything off the wall](https://i.imgur.com/MyxfEnh.jpg) at very reasonable prices to have with your delicious food. No we didn't drink Vina Tondonia. *Whose it for:* Tourists, locals, people who want vermouth a good bottle selection and lots of tasty seafood. 

* [La Graciosa](https://www.facebook.com/lagraciosabcn/): Definitely a nerdy and serious place for natural wine lovers. Lots of funky weird stuff, but didn't take themselves too seriously. Only remembered to snap a pic of the [whites we drank](https://i.imgur.com/7orxNQZ.jpg). Wish we could've stayed longer but they had an event about to start which included a bunch of unlabeled bottles being pulled out of suitcases. If you're into the natty side of natural wine this is your place. *Whose it for:* People open to new wine experiences on the natty wine end of things.

* [Bar Salvatge](https://barsalvatge.com/): This is what happens when natty wine goes mainstream. Loud, popular environment. Ten wines available on tap in different levels of fritzy and fruity to brett-bombs. Not to my taste but an interesting riff to see what happens when this style of natural wines make it to a non-wine nerd crowd who just likes a new approach and feeling to a wine bar. *Whose it for* You want loud vibrant scene, beautiful people, and cheap natty wine from the barrel.

* [La Vinya del Senyor](https://www.facebook.com/vinyadelsenyor/): Stumbled across this place wandering around the neighborhood, and what a delight. Nice outside patio, cozy inside, great seafood and great variety of classic wines by the glass. Not the cheapest place, but compared to what you spend in the US, still a bargin. Oh, and if you like sherry -- they've got a full page of it by the glass. This [manzanilla and oyster pairing](https://i.imgur.com/91SwDvO.jpg) was the pairing of the trip for me. They also had quite the selection of wines on Coravin allowing you taste some spendier bottles like this [local elegant and powerful merlot blend](https://i.imgur.com/nb3BS11.jpg). *Whose it for:* Someone looking for a quite, romantic few glasses on a beautiful patio. And sherry nerds.

* [Boedga Maestrazgo](http://bodegamaestrazgo.com/): [Half bottle shop, half wine bar.](https://i.imgur.com/tzg1A4T.jpg) Everything from very inexpensive (3euro/liter) bulk wine to go, to a whole range of quality producers. Super friendly staff. We drank glasses of this [very nicely acidic bierzo](https://i.imgur.com/7cBmPTz.jpg) that reminded us of cab franc from the Loire which is one of our go to faves. Highly recommend a stop here for a bottle to go, to get mix for sangria, and a glass along the way. We grabbed an inexpensive (15euro?) bottle of 2010 reserva cava for [our picnic the next day.](https://i.imgur.com/5gwpSmT.jpg). *Whose it for*: Someone who needs to buy a few bottles, make sangria, and is looking for that neighborhood bottle shop with well informed staff.

* [Bar Brutal](http://cancisa.cat/): The older sibling of Bar Salvatge and one we enjoyed a good bit more. More toned down from full on natty. Night we happened in was a tasting of Christian Tschida wines -- with [not quite-full pours of 5 cuvees](https://i.imgur.com/py1F6Gc.jpg) for 15 euros a pop.  Somms here were eager to talk about each one and just seemed to really be enjoying their nights. Tons of regulars mixed in with the many tourists you always find in this bit of town. *Whose it for*: You're not cool enough for Bar Salvatge, but you like natural wine and a busy atmosphere with passionate people.

and we saved the big dog for the final night

* [Monvinic](http://www.monvinic.com/): This place is serious. Huge lists, awesome by the glass selection. Quiet atmosphere and very focused customers. A very different vibe, service not eager to explain things to you as perhaps they assume you already know a good bit. The ipad based lists are impressive and--frankly--necessary for navigating. We tasted through 8 half glasses, had some simple tapas (bread and cheese) and were out for about 60euro. Started with [two very different whites](https://i.imgur.com/OuYzuq8.jpg) \-- the muscat being just so pretty, fresh and full of flowers. On to some local reds -- [a small batch sumoll and a marselan](https://i.imgur.com/ReFq2Dm.jpg). The marselan -- a grape I hadn't been exposed to -- was the standout here as bringing just the right amount of cab sauv seriousness to the fruit profile. A bottle I'll certainly look for in the future. Then two more Spanish -- a sulphur and white-pepper nosed [red from the Canary islands](https://i.imgur.com/LTPz2Db.jpg), followed up by a powerful, smooth and just-the-right-amount-of-oak [gran reserva rioja.](https://i.imgur.com/iikjexf.jpg) That was supposed to be the end of it, but we decided we had time for two more wines which generally would be outside our budget. So we had a glass of [1er cru Burgundy](https://i.imgur.com/N2WvbGR.jpg) (which reminded me why I can't drink Burgundy often because I'll fall in love as it just tastes to me like some Platonic ideal of wine in my head, and I can't afford it). And then finished on a [2012 Pomerol](https://i.imgur.com/0ahOQv7.jpg) \-- the fiance's favorite of the night. *Whose it for:* You don't mind a stuffier atmosphere if it means you get to drink incredible wines.

**Toledo**

* No wine bars to mention but we bought [this bottle of ""#Garagewine""](https://i.imgur.com/vThAlEG.jpg) on a whim at a [well stocked local shop](http://casacuartero.com/). After drinking overly-young-overly-oak Rioja for a few days, this was the expression of local cencibel ( Tempranillo ) I needed: medium bodied, fruit forward, plenty of acid, lots of cherries. 

**Madrid**

* [Vino y Compania](http://vinoycompania.blogspot.com/): A small neighborhood wine shop right around the corner from our place. Super friendly staff, big selections in every price range, focused on smaller producers. We had a [few tasty bottles from there](https://i.imgur.com/daGkr5w.jpg) (and one great bottle of ""cuvee"" saison from a nearby beer shop.)
* [La Venencia](https://goo.gl/maps/VHSr1vPCSNMrv8Sm7): Prior to this trip I'd had sherry maybe twice in my life, to start off fancy dinners in England. I was young, it wasn't memorable. This place is going to be to blame for a new habit. Holy shit is it what my palate needed after a bunch of oaked Riojas. Sherry only, all of it straight from the cask. Fino and Manzanilla for 1.80euro,  Amontillado, Oloroso, Palo Cortado for 2.20euro per pour. Simple tapas including the best free olives you'll get anywhere. The vibrancy and slightly yeasty characteristics of fino were tops for me but all were just so new to my taste buds that it was hard to process. No tipping, [no pictures](https://i.imgur.com/HC1h2jB.jpg) (yes I failed, that's our tab). We had a drink here in the afternoon, then came back and closed the place down that night. The fiance and I have an expression for when we find a place we want to melt into for a long time: ""I live here now."" I said that about La Venecia from the 3rd day of our trip when we found it, til we left 6 days later from Barcelona. *Whose it for* Those who need nothing more from life than perfect fresh sherry, simple food, and an interior that hasn't changed since 1930. 

Hope this can be of use to future wine travelers to these cities, and would love to read about other places local wine scenes. Sometimes its just too hard to get out to the vineyards and experiencing a massive variety of wine with passionate people when we travel is the bees knees."

As of right now, I pull corks, though if the account has a Coravin I'll use it.  For any open bottles, I'll roll around with them the next day (after testing in the AM for freshness and never presenting after the 30-hour mark); any Coravin-ed bottles I consider viable for one week, less if more than a quarter of the bottle was poured.

I have been looking at the [Repour](https://www.repour.com/pages/how-it-works) and [ZOS Halo](https://zos.wine/pages/the-technology) systems.  My primary concern with them is how travel will affect the wine: I am driving a lot every day, including elevation changes (from sea level and over mountain ranges) and winding backroads, not to mention the agitation the bottles face as the sample bag rolls along the sidewalk (sometimes over cobblestones too...).  Conceptually I am wondering how well they would keep sealed under these conditions, if the wine splashing up into the oxygen-absorbing material would compromise/negate it, and what a buyer would think when I present a bottle thusly sealed to him/her.

Are there any road-warrior reps out there with experience using these and if yes, are they worthwhile?  Would it be better to bite the bullet and get a Coravin for selective use (I wouldn't use it for the value-end of the portfolio obviously), or stick to the current gameplan eschewing all preservation methods and open fresh bottles?"

Re: Opposition to Tariffs on Imported Wine from the European Union

 

Dear Amb. Lighthizer:

 

I am writing as a customer and consumer of imported and domestic wines that is concerned with the multiple rounds of tariffs that are being imposed and considered on wine from the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù). I strongly urge you not to punish me, or my fellow wine lovers, or hardworking wine retailers, for problems we didn‚Äôt cause. It‚Äôs unfair at face value. You should punish those responsible. Punishing Airbus and their suppliers and French digital services companies would be much more effective, as well as fair.

Beginning on October 18, 2019, the U.S. Government imposed a 25-percent tariff on certain French wine as part of retaliatory tariffs against the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù) after the World Trade Organization authorized retaliation for the EU‚Äôs failure to comply with WTO rulings on subsidies provided to Airbus. All the while Airbus itself was only issued a 10% tariff. I understand that a 100-percent tariff is proposed on French sparkling wine (consisting mostly of champagne) and that this tariff is part of the Section 301 duties imposed on imports from France as a result of the country‚Äôs Digital Services Tax (‚ÄúDST‚Äù). Finally, on December 10, 2019, USTR proposed imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent on all wines from the EU.

Because of these import tariffs, the prices will go up dramatically for wine. Margins on wine are extremely small, and the sale of wine is highly regulated, with virtually every state imposing a three-tier distribution system with markups occurring at each tier of distribution. Thus, a 25-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 50-percent increase and a 100-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 150-percent increase in prices for a consumer like me.

 

There is no substitute for imports of wine from the EU. Wines from the EU are different from domestic wines and wines from other countries as a matter of consumer taste. In addition, because it takes many years to plant new grape vineyards and allow the vineyards to produce mature fruit that can be harvested to make wine, it will take at least a decade before the U.S. domestic wine industry could ever be in a position to begin replacing wine imports from the EU.

 

As a wine consumer, I do not understand why individual consumers like me and small U.S. businesses should suffer because of a dispute involving Boeing and Airbus or France‚Äôs digital services tax. Retaliatory tariffs on these matters should target Airbus and their suppliers who benefitted from the subsidies, and French digital services companies.

I recently moved and joined a wine club through a local shop: every quarter there's a club event with food/drinks and you pick out your wine from multiple local wineries. If you do not attend the event, you get assigned wine from whatever is left over and you pick it up/it's shipped.

My job has unexpectedly involved a lot of travel lately, and I would like to bow out of the club*. I responded to their most recent email - an invitation to the next member event - letting them know I can't attend due to work, and in light of my new job could I please cancel my subscription and hopefully rejoin in the summer when travel will have subsided? I was told ""we can let you skip this one event, but our wine club membership is for one year."" 

If I'm stuck in this club I'll live, of course. But has anyone else successfully extricated themselves from a club...and how? 

*In the event it's important, reasons include: I've missed previous wine club event since joining due to work-related travel for a new job and the event itself was my main reason for joining - so I could make local friends!, my fiance decided to stop drinking wine which makes a club less economical/fun...and frankly, I am not very impressed with the wines they have chosen for me."

In the past I'd tried to enjoy wine but whenever I tried it, my face scrunched up like a baby trying lemon for the first time. I was sure that I read that if that was the case I should try a sweeter wine, so I got gradually sweeter until I was at port. It was still the same problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I did a bit more research this past week and found it likely wasn't the sweetness but the acidity and tartness I was finding unbearable. So I looked in to Merlot. Definitely a marked improvement but I am not sure if it's something I just need to get used to or whether there are practical options for a lower acid red wine type.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy whisky and have read that full-bodied Italian is the way to go but looking at them it looks like they're really acidic, so I really don't know where to turn at this point.

I never really drank wine prior to 3 years ago when I got handed the keys to wine purchasing, read a book or two, and spent the last three years drinking too much wine, and having it capture my imagination.

Any other recommendations for a cheap moscato besides Bare Foot? Or a sweet, cheap wine? (I can't stand dry!)

Utterly exceptional glass, head and shoulders above the Zalto Universal, and hands down the best beer glass I've ever used- just does incredible things to the mouthfeel.

Wasn't going to be possible to replace it (sent to NZ from mother in law in Germany) so I thought repair was worth a go.

Wasn't expecting this to work even vaguely well, it just seemed like a shitty thing ppl do for instagram likes and then toss the glass cos it's actually all wobbly and useless. Buuuuut, I have to say, as ghetto as it might look, I am pretty impressed with the 'jam it into a cork' strategy. Possibly more effective on finer/lighter glassware, than on the chunkier stuff, I suspect. This has been through the dishwasher a coupla times, and while the cork has expanded, its integrity is unchanged.

Yes, it's a bit wobbly, no I didn't get it quite straight, but that's OK! It LIVES ON.

Used a composite cork (partly as that's what was still lying on the table, partly cos I thought the resinous nature could provide better stability) but I'll def do this again next time I break summin, and try natural cork for comparison.

Do to the rules, I wont post the link, however I have attached a picture. They currently sell on amazon, but I am trying to find where else I would be able to sell these, thanks!

I'm going to start going to a more local shop where I can talk directly to the owner about specific bottles, but even still, what are people's thoughts on buying wine that's more than just 2, 3, 4 years old at a big box retailer? I know Total Wine gets a bit of a bad rap, and locally in Dallas, TX we also have Goody Goody (it's at least only a north Texas chain, not a national one). But anyway, how do we know when a specific bottle was actually released? How long as that store had it? If it's a 2015 released in 2017, have they just had it for 3 years? Stored at room temperature?? I hope not... (As an aside, what's generally the most common amount of time for a winery to bottle age, i.e. time between harvest, barrel, bottle, and release). I've seen things like a 2012 Barolo going for about $40 and I just couldn't bring myself to buy it. I can't imagine that winery held onto that bottle more than 2-3 years, meaning it had potentially been outside of proper storage for 3-4 years (this was in 2019). 

My wife just bought me a bottle of **Maison Denuziere Cote Rotie Les Hauts Lieux 2015** from Total Wine for my birthday and I am ***psyched*** about it. I just can't help but be worried about how long TW may have had it, was it stored in any decent way, etc."
1975,es92rt,Advice for making most of Tuscany with 2 days in Florence?,wine,"Several questions regarding **where to go** and **how to get there** with regards to Tuscany and the wine regions:

**Background**: Traveling as two 20 something year olds with lots of travel/food/wine experience but not a huge budget for this short trip. Of note, I'm not really into touristy vineyards but would appreciate more of an agriturismo/local/organic/artisan food type vibe + outstanding wineries who care a lot about their product (but not necessarily top international names).  Because of this, I'm apprehensive to book day trip tours on Viator etc. We're staying in Florence because we've already been and done the tourist attractions but are trying to train around Italy to fit in odds and ends.

**Where to go/tour recommendations?:** Would obviously prefer to not have to drive since we're on limited time and don't want the hassle, but would like as relaxing and pleasant/high value of an experience as we can (&lt;$200 each?). We're right now most likely going to be based in Florence, and would like some guidance on spending one full day in wine country. Not sure if people would recommend Chianti (it seems somewhat touristy but obviously more convenient), but I do have familiarity with Montepulciano and Brunello wines and enjoy them.

Also any Florence food/shop/eatery/fine goods recs would be appreciated, thanks!

To start we had a cocktail each - she had vodka with yuzu and I had a Negroni, followed by a bottle of Ruinart with Caviar, three different kinds of Oysters (from light and aromatic to rich and creamy) then squid neck. I begun choosing the red, wanting to leave it open for at least 2 hours. I originally picked a 2010 Clape Cornas but alas they were sold out. So I opted for a 2012 Luciano Sandrone Le Vigne. I have had these on release, though never with some age to them.

We then ordered two steaks, both dry aged for 36 months. One was a fillet and other rib eye on the bone, with sides. Then came the wine.

Far out what a wine - after 2 hours decanting this showed off in a big way: plums, fresh mint, orange slices, mixed herbs, fine tannin, acidity in check and long length in the every sip. Perfect with the steaks.So much feeling and joy from a top producer such as this. A 9.5/10 for me.

Finished on dessert with a glass of Kraacher, and I tipped our waiter and Somm a glass each of the red - they were happy, and so were we!

Everyone of them made profits and the best was someone who in 2003 asked me to invest ¬£6000 for him. Three years later he died and the wine was sold. The widow collected ¬£18,000 from a then highly tax efficient investment. I left shortly afterwards and lost contact with the sector. However I understand that namely with the opening of China, supplies, prices and acquisitions of Fine Wines, have caused that market to have its ups and downs in the past 10 years. Nonetheless I would like to revisit that sector now but as a Fine Wine investor. I would welcome your comments especially about investing opportunities that may exist in the 'New World' wines"

What I'm finding though is the lack of knowledge in the boutique stores is frustrating. This past week I had a woman telling me that wine was from ""the Russian River AVA, whatever AVA means"". And when I explained I was looking to compare oaked vs. unoaked  examples of a grape and was thinking of a Napa chardonnay versus a Chablis, she asked: ""Why not get two chardonnay?""

1. Stand them at room temp 
2. Give up wine fridge space and make a custom shelf to hold bottles upright.
3. Wine-cradles / Don't stand 
4. Suck it up and buy an extra fridge.

Standing at room temp isn't viable here as it gets way too hot for most of the year to let the stand for that long.

Wine-fridge space is doable, but frustrating as cuts down on options I can store at home and has me fighting my offsite too much. On the plus side as long as I don't stand too much I might have room for the decanter in the fridge.

Cradles tend to cause more waste and can be fiddly especially if slow-oxing."

&amp;#x200B;

After having enjoyed a regular red burgundy from 2017 and a C√¥te de Nuits-Villages from 2012 I'd like to try either a great village wine (maybe Fixin or Vosne-Roman√©e?) or a premier cru from the C√¥te de Nuits. While it was easy to find a good quality regular red burg and a good C√¥te de Nuits-Villages, I have no idea what to look for in a high-quality village wine or a premier cru. 

Are Vivino ratings an improtant thing to look for and should I buy something online with a high rating or should I walk into my local wine store and ask them to help me pick a bottle? Are vintages very important and should I skip 2013 or isn't it that important?

I've also heard that one of the main things that distinguishes good red burgundy wines is the ability to improve over age, so should I only look for older vintages or will newer ones also be worth the money?

And one last question, in what way do young premier cru wines differ from young village ones? Is it just an improvement of the wine's balance of flavours or is there also added complexity (even though both wines are young)?

Some producers that I have access to include Drouhin, Domaine Robert Sirugue, Domaine Huguenot, Domaine Chopin, JC Boisset and Vougeraie (but I could also try find some Meo Camuzet online).

I'd appreciate some advice since I have no idea what to look for :-)"

Mind you, I drank plenty of amazing ""red label"" and ‚Äúblue label‚Äù Rioja in Spain, and they've always been a treat, but when they wanted to share their ""best stuff,"" in almost every instance they reached for something with a green label, meaning it did not qualify as one of the typical classifications. They often used different oak, or less oak, or, in one case, aged it in amphora. Alternatively, they showcased some of their eccentric younger wines, ones that were complex but exhibited a much more fruit-forward experience than the typical Rioja. One winemaker summed it up like this: drinking a gran reserva is like listening to Frank Sinatra, drinking this (green label wine) is like listening to Frank Ocean. One is classic, one is new-age, both have merits.

In the way of local wines, I like the Tahbilk Marsanne because it is affordable ($12) and lovely‚Äîif you decant it!

I also like the De Bortoli Cuv√©e Blanc for its relative price compared to its quality. It‚Äôs not a perfect, or even a great sparkling wine, but it‚Äôs $17 and you won‚Äôt see much that‚Äôs anything near the same quality at that price in Australia. The Stonier Pinot ($20 IIRC) is lovely as well but it‚Äôs for those who prefer the more subtle, watery type of pinot‚ÄîI like the translucent feel but for those who like stronger tastes it could seem a bit dilute. The Turkey Flat Ros√© is pretty lovely as well, it‚Äôs a cliche by now though.

I‚Äôd love to hear from others who have tried a couple of different wines and formed some sort of view. Also interested to hear about some more expensive wines (as in $40-100) because I don‚Äôt have the chance to taste them generally, but if there‚Äôs one that‚Äôs very well-regarded enough I could justify putting a bit extra towards them.

2127,eoa6si,Help choosing some Burgundy bottles,wine,"I am still pretty new to wine collecting but have mostly bought and followed Barolo/Barbaresco, Rioja, and Rh√¥ne wines, with a little Bordeaux and Chianti/Brunello, but have basically zero experience with Burgundy. I spend pretty much all I can afford keeping up with what I already know I like, so I'm not looking for a new way to spend thousands of dollars, but I'd at least like to get a handful of bottles as a sampling to have a better idea what decent to good Burgundy (Pinot) is like. Maybe two or three bottles each of entry level, Villages, and 1er cru (maybe even one or two grand cru though not sure if I'm looking to spend that much right away) to have something to drink sooner and something to cellar for a while. But I have no idea what I'm looking for and have had a much more difficult time making sense of subregions and producers than with other regions.

I prefer 'old school'/traditional reds with less oak, ripeness, alcohol, and extraction and more structure, terroir, and elegance. Rustic/brett is totally fine. Any help figuring out which producers might be up my alley, or particular bottles to look for, would be great. Especially anything that I can actually buy right away (I've done most of my shopping through online retailers because local selection is pretty bad and prices are fairly high--I live in Tennessee)."

I have lots of questions about this side of the business. 

I‚Äôve been in wine and spirits sales for the past 5 years. And have been on the distribution side for about 3 years.  And this might be a bit of a pipe dream, but it‚Äôs at least something I‚Äôm thinking about further down the road. 

I‚Äôve got a lot of questions and I‚Äôd appreciate any responses you‚Äôre willing to give. Or if you want to DM that works too. 



How did you start in the wine business?


Do you import and distribute to on/off premise or import and supply distributors?


Did/does your business have a central theme or focus(other than making money) - such as a focus on Loire/Burgundy/piedmont/natural etc. 


Did you start with a group of producers from one region or several regions/countries?


What is something you wish you had known or started early in the life of the business?


What was your biggest challenge besides selling all of your products?


How prohibitive was governmental red tape?


How difficult was it to find proper shipping partners?


How long after starting was your company profitable?


Did you start with multiple employees or just yourself?



Again I appreciate your time and any responses you‚Äôre willing to share. 

Thank you"

Whatsapp from a Senior Sommelier of 10 years at hatted/michelin restaurants for when you are out, or needing a buying recommendation - but no Sommelier is around, or the waitstaff/bottle shop staff don't know.",wine,"[https://askthesomm.carrd.co/](https://askthesomm.carrd.co/)  


Hi there,   


My name is Aaron, as my thread title says I am a Senior Sommelier of 10 years, and 7 months ago became a Dad, so I moved into IT during the day to be home of an evening - though I still love wine and still wanted to be a part of it somehow. I always get asked at work for wine recommendations, and being a guest myself at different places of late I was left disappointed by the service - so I believe strongly there is room in the world for something like this.  


Way it works is simple - you message me on Whatsapp where you are eating (if outside of Australia, please provide state/country), what you mainly plan to eat, style of wine you want (bubbly, white, red? Sweet, dry, light, full?) and price range approx - then leave the rest to me! I look up the menu online, and if not available, I'll ask for a photo of the wine page that interests you.  


As this is a new idea, it is currently free to use. If you do use it, would appreciate if you share this with your friends and any feedback.   


Important to note I am from Australia, so if you are from a different timezone to me (like EU/US) then there will be a delay in me getting back to you - so thanks for waiting and I will get back asap.

2162,en8leb,A tip for all future wine tourists in the Rhine region (Germany),wine,"I was just travelling from South to North by train and realized that this might be a cool idea for everyone who has never been to this beautiful region before (especially us wine enthusiasts ;) -- if you want to see the most pictoresque/scenic part of the Rhine and the most important wine growing area along this river, just book a train ticket from Mainz to Koblenz (or in the opposite direction) and make sure that it is the EC train (Euro City, usually from Zurich to Hamburg; NOT the ICE which runs through a tunnel) -- this is the important part!! Then book a seat at the window front and make sure you travel during the day (when there is light) -- the train travels directly through the Rhine valley and passes all those beautiful spots like the Loreley, a hundred castles and ALL of the vineyards on the surrounding steep hills. A great experience that never get's old and is so cheap that you have more money left for the lots of good wine you want to take home with you ;)
Hope someone will try! :)"

2013 Blanc - Surely one of the best whites to come from Bordeaux. So refreshing with this tropical lime, white flowers and fresh cream profile, fine acidity and length. Vanished quickly.   


We didn't taste these in any particular order - just poured out and tried side by side to each other.   


1998 - Creme brulee, white flowers, apricot, pineapple. Medium bodied and not rich like other vintages. Super complex. Big tick for me, my kind of Sauternes.   


2005 - Wild nose. Honey, almond, pear juice. Again, the complexity will slow you down drinking this in the best way possible. A lighter tasting style again. Very good.   


1987 - Orange, flowers, some herbal vibes - pretty straight forward. It was okay, didn't really excite me.   


My overall pick of the evening? The Blanc!

He's an advanced wine connoisseur, but I am not.  Could you help me with what to get him?  Unfortunately, I don't know what he likes, but I'm going to take a conservative approach and say Old World over New World.

Also, I've been introduced to the idea of a horizontal wine tasting, and I think this would be a fun way to get him a few good wines rather than one expensive wine.

I am budgeting $100-200 for this.

I‚Äôm trying to expand my horizon and would therefore like some recommendations of your favorite wines in the $20-$50 range (USD) which you would recommend. I‚Äôm pretty open to anything so any style or varietal is welcome. I know that the Wine Bible provides some suggestions on producers for each region, so that may be a resource to look into; however, I think an open discussion of this form would be quite interesting.

Perhaps we could also expand the sidebar for $20-$50, $50-$100, $100-$250, $250-$500, to have a permanent resource, although that‚Äôs quite ambitious.

To start off (and quite commonly known):

Lopez de Heredia Tondonia is a great sub $50 wine which has beautiful structure, flavour, with quite significant age for its price.

EDIT:

I'm going to start compiling these suggestions by region with prices, probably won‚Äôt get to it until tomorrow. Thanks!"

Now I have to store them until early April. I have a wine fridge, but it isn‚Äôt big enough for all 20 bottles.

I‚Äôve also read conflicting advice as to whether sparkling wine should be stored horizontally or vertically, and the fact that it‚Äôs just a few months seems to matter as well.

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for two different meals picked by my companion.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Broccoli Cottage ""Cannelloni"". Recipe: https://divaliciousrecipes.com/broccoli-ricotta-cannelloni/ . We will use cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

The second is a Cauliflower Pork Fried Rice. Recipe: https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/cauliflower-pork-fried-rice/

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

I do have a couple of wines that should go sooner rather than later - but unsure if these would make good pairings with these dishes. The estimated drink-by date are underneath. 
In addition, I also have a Repour'ed  2005 Domaine G. Roumier Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Cras and 2015 G√©rard Bertrand Pinot Gris Blanc	 Pays d'Oc. Finally, a 2008 Guti√©rrez Colosia, Oloroso Sherry is also an option because somebody told me I should drink that one sooner rather than later

1. We want to take a boat tour to sightsee. Quinta Nova offers one from Ferr√£o to Pinh√£o. Is this stretch particularly beautiful? Or should we look for a boat tour that goes from Pinh√£o eastward? If the latter, any recommendations for an operator?

2. Then we plan to go to dinner at DOC. It is on the other side of the river from Quinta Nova, so we are thinking to take the train from Ferrao to Covelinhas and cross there by boat to Folgosa. Has anyone done this? Then we to take a taxi/hired driver home. Is it possible to find a taxi at DOC, or should we pre-arrange?

3. For our second day, we would love to bop around winery to winery, but it seems like it is going to be extremely pricey to hire a private driver and that nearly all tours start/end in Porto. We are thinking of just go to Pinh√£o and doing a few near there by walking/taxi (Bomfim, Seixo, and la Rosa). Are we making a mistake by doing this? Will it be overrun with tourists?

After months of emails and phone calls for wine orders and recommendations for dinners they would have, I got invited over as this persons Housekeeper wanted my opinion on their cellar. I would spend the next few days creating a spreadsheet of everything they had - stuff to drink now, throw out and keep with recommended drinking windows. It was an extensive list that went into the hundreds of items and would take me a month to finish properly with researching bottles. I sent the spreadsheet off and didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a fortnight. Eventually the housekeeper got back to me and couldn‚Äôt believe the data within it, and asked to send an invoice. I replied back it was no charge (they were already spending crazy amounts for dinner parties and gifts). I didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a week and got invited over to theirs again for coffee and lunch - and that‚Äôs when this wine came out. It would be the first of a number of crazy ones I had only ever read about, yet here I was now having them at this persons house. For lunch, it was some ham and salad rolls! The wine of course is what you would expect from such a name and vintage and perfectly cellared - powerful, fresh blue fruit still present with a deep blue jam flavour, graphite and a smoked wood flavour. The finish lasted minutes. Crazy wine.

I guess this has been asked a few times on /r/wine before, but I'm still not sure so I thought I'd ask again!

&amp;#x200B;

I don't work in wine, but am an enthusiast and have learnt quite a lot from reading online (Jancis Robinson / Wikipedia). I also have done a beginner's winetasting course, which was great fun. 

I recently got myself the study book for WSET Level 2 and have read most of it - I learnt a lot from the winemaking section, but would say I was already pretty familiar with the different grape varieties / standard regions.

I'd like to take a WSET course (onsite at their school in London), but I'm not sure if I should go for Level 2 or Level 3. Level 3 seems like it would be more interesting, and I'd learn a lot more. (I'm also pretty confident I could pass the Level 2 exam right now.) But from reading on here it seems like there's a huge jump between Level 2 and Level 3, and I'm not sure if I'll have enough tasting experience to get enough out of Level 3, or if it'll just be too difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm relatively new to wine, and I've been shopping in the $15-$20 price range, which seems to be a reasonable area for drinking 1-2 bottles a month, as I do. However, I'm a little intimidated by going into wine shops and being faced with big selections of seemingly-identical (to my uneducated eye) products.

I'm curious what you guys look for on the bottle to help you make a decision, especially when there are multiple bottles that appear similar on the surface, but have different price points (for example, I just did a quick search online for 2015 Barbera d'Albas from Piedmont, and found 8 different bottles ranging from $12 to $38). Are there any big red flags that would steer you away from a particular bottle (like brands that are well-known to be subpar)?

I'm used to shopping in the Scotch/Rum space, were I can look at information like age, cask type, origin (for Rum especially), or ABV to make a decision; I just haven't built up that ""vocabulary"" for wine yet.

Additionally - are there any good blogs/websites/YouTube channels/podcasts that help you stay up to date with the current wine market?"

Long time lurker, looking for help organizing a trip to Mendoza. I work as a sommelier in Canada and am taking a few weeks to explore Mendoza this month! I think I'll mostly stick to bike or larger bus tours as I'm unfortunately not able to break the bank this trip. Any feedback on particular companies would be greatly appreciated along with specific wineries or wine bars that shouldn't be missed, of course. I've searched previous posts for advice as well but any new recommendations would be great.

Also, I am particularly interested to do some work on a vineyard in exchange for housing. I have experience working in wineries and had a work-stay opportunity fall through recently so if anyone in the province needs an extra body for a few weeks let me know! Or if you have a connection there that would be interested in something like this I'd love to get in touch."

Hi! I work at a liquor store in sw Missouri! I love my job, as it works really well with my school schedule. I am probably the most knowledgeable person there on beer, and most people defer questions and phone calls to me on the topic. So its definitely safe to say that beer is my wheel house. I do love wine, but I'm learning. I dont know nearly as much as my coworkers do about it.

Some work drama happened and the wine managers position was dissolved and she quit. I mentioned a few months ago that I would really like to round myself out and work in the wine room so I can learn! My boss took that, and decided that I should run the wine room! So here I am, a total beer guy... with his own wine room... 

Now before you jump the gun, I've read the FAQ and the beginners guide so I do have what I think is a minimum base knowledge about wine. But what I'm here today for is... help, honestly. 

I havent tasted much wine and I dont have the budget to just buy a bunch right now. I'm also just not really familiar with how to help potential customers. In my beer section, I've had most of what people ask about, so helping is usually pretty easy. But if someone were to ask me the differences between different sav' blancs, I know that I would just be a bumbling idiot. 

I know some of you will say ""just do your best and try stuff and make your own opinions as you go!"", which I will absolutely be doing! But I just need some help. 

Tell me your opinions on wines! Tell me your hot takes! Tell me what gets your goat about this one winery! Tell me what I might expect from some of my customers and how I can sort of bullshit some of my way though this period! Anything from anyone is going to be a huge help! So please dont be afraid! 

Edit: spelling

* Pour into a large wine glass, swirl and sniff 5/6 times.

* Drink and swirl around mouth 

* for each sip I focus on one thing e.g. Acidity, body, length etc and jot down what I notice. 

* I then jot down an overall review of what I actually thought (e.g. bit tart for my liking but might go well with food etc).

* Give it another smell and taste as I often find I smell things I didn't catch before after a short break (or it's just oxidized properly because I'm impatient)

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Chickpea Cauliflower Eggplant Tomato Stew. Recipe: http://eastvanvegan.com/eggplant-chickpea-tagine-vegan-gf/ Website appears to be down but the ingredients are listed. Harissa, chili, mint, parsley as seasonings.

2373,eiox8d,**MWC Experimental Series #1! January 2020 Selection Post!**,wine,"Hello everyone and Happy New year!  I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season, and welcome to the January installment of the Monthly Wine Challenge! Thanks to some wonderful dialogue in the last couple of months, I felt that with the new year, it is time to try something new for the MWC.  For the most part, there won't be much of a difference.  I'm still going to hold to the format of region and grape.  But I'm also going to switch it up from time to time, and I'm hoping that this will stop the stagnation that has been plaguing us lately.  I'm going to be calling this the Experimental Series, inspired by a series of scotch that my dad has from the Glenfiddich distillery.  And with that, there is no time like the present.  So, with that  in mind, lets discover what this month has in store for us:  


**Grape:** Pinot Noir  
**Country and Region #1:** USA, Pacific North West  
**Country and Region #2:** New Zealand, Any  


Thats right!  Not one, but TWO regions this month!  I've always wanted to try to include comparative tastings to the MWC, but until now, I was unsure how to do it.  So, for the first entry into the MWC Experimental Series, I have decided on pinot noir from the PNW of the US, with one from anywhere in New Zealand.  As I am not very familiar with either region, I felt this was a good place to start.  Feel free to post notes for multiple bottles.  If you have 2 from one region and one from another, go ahead!  Can only find one region, and not the other, thats ok to.  Just post what notes you have.  Otherwise, the format will not be much different from previous challenges.    


So, just like with past MWC entries, us on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.), and e) if you preferred one style over the other.

If you are new to wine tasting, [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/2015/08/25/how-to-taste-wine/) has a great article to get you going.  Have fun choosing your wine, and I will see you all on the 15th!

See you on the 15th!  If you have suggestions for future comparative tastings, or just a suggestion for one of our regular tastings, please feel free to message me.

I'd like some suggestions for what wines I should consider for this and what the wines are like. Thank you!"

My wife told me to pick a wine class I wanted to attend as a Christmas present.  Having read a lot and knowing what I""m good at (acidity, alcohol, identifying oak, earth aromas, and general wine knowledge) and what I'm bad at (fruit aromas and floral aromas), I was wondering if a wine aroma kit might be a better investment.

I'm good at identifying oak and general wine structure, but more than a little embarrassed, that I don't get raspberry rather than just ""general fruit"".  I can get barnyard, earthy, mushroom, but rose vs. marigold or strawberry vs blackberry and I'm just guessing.  Weird thing is, I taste a lot better than I smell.  Okay, that sounded bad . . . uh, my sense of taste of those things is much better than me trying to smell them before drinking.

I've read good things about Le Nez du Vin, but man that's expensive ($400).  I thought about doing my own, but I have a lot of other time commitments.  So a kit is probably worth it.  Maybe?

What are your all's thoughts on courses versus the aroma kits?  Anybody done the WSET2 or 3 stuff?  Recommend an aroma kit?

Thanks."

For some background, I never drank wine until meeting my current fiancee. Her family is big on wine, mine liquor. My new father in law in particular is a huge wine connoisseur. Every time we're together we're opening mostly $75+ bottles. 

My fiancee and I are now in Oregon and have obviously discovered the point noir. But our budget is more $10-15 bottles. Every time the in laws are in town we're going to the best wineries or wine bars. Spent yesterday tasting at beaux freres and Bergstrom and came home with a few cases gifted to us as well. This is pretty typical. 

So my question I guess. I've been fortunate to try enough amazing wines that i can enjoy it and tell when I'm drinking a really nice wine. But i don't have much of a defined palette for it and wish i could appreciate more or say more than just ""wow this is good"". I've been to a number of great tastings.

2441,ehmgwv,Question about returning flawed bottle,wine,"I would like some advice from restaurant professionals on how I could have better handled a situation I was in last night. I was out to dinner at a moderately upscale restaurant with like 12 people last night and ordered a bottle of 2016 ridge zin for myself. The wine was obviously flawed, cooked, had no fresh fruit, smelled like off prunes. Overall palate was thin and unappetizing. As to not cause a scene and get chastised by my non wine drinking extended family I took my glass to the bar to get his opinion and get a new bottle. He smelled it and thought it was port before I even told him what wine I had ordered. The waitress comes to the table and takes the bottle and returns with a decanter filled with a ‚Äúnew‚Äù ridge zin. This time I try it and it either has the same flaw or is the same wine since I never saw her open the new bottle. I shrugged it off again as to not be called picky or something by my family. I should have probably complained but just let it go. Was I justified in returning the bottle? And how could I have handled it differently? Seems like bad practice to return with a new wine in a decanter.

Update: I called and spoke with the manager and he agreed it was wrong of the server to bring the new wine decanted and not open it in front of me. He also said he‚Äôs gonna pop another bottle open to see if the others are also flawed. Issued a full refund for the wine and was very nice and respectful."

I know nebbiolo is one but it doesn't reach the same heights as it does in Italy. I've had aleatico as a dessert wine and it was absolutely amazing which got me thinking how it would do as a dry still wine. If anyone can offer any other red grapes that has rose as a descriptor I would be forever thankful!"

2473,eh5yle,One of my 2019 highlights: Clos Mogador 2011,wine,"I was blown away by this one yesterday:  [https://www.instagram.com/p/B6oinC3io5c/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6oinC3io5c/) 

Nose: Immensely dense and compley. At first, loads of red and dark fruit. Ripe cherries, blackberries, plums, blueberries.. Then, with swirling, olives, laurel berry leaves, tobacco and leather. I spent over 10 minutes with just sniffing.

Palate: It's like a fruit tsunami overwhelming yor. Needs some time to identify all the aromes, because there are so many. Everyhing I got in the nose is also present on the palate, with a great clarity and precision. It's like looking on the many facings of a diamond that changes its appearens when you turn it around in the light. The acidity and density is amazing, the 15,5% feel like 13,5%. The wine is at the same time overwhelming and elegant. The finish is basically endless, adding on the primary notes salty caramel, leather, burnt almonds, cinnamon and eucalyptus. Despite the complexity it screams for the next sip.

Score: 97/100, I agree with the high parker scores on this winery.

On top, it's really affordable, I payd around 60‚Ç¨ three years ago. The only wine that I rated higher this year was 2016 Figeac, which sells for around 250‚Ç¨ at the moment."
2474,eh34n7,Barolo | Old vs. New style Explanation Request,wine,I hear a lot of people say this Barolo is more traditional in style vs the more modern method that came about in the 80's. Can someone comment on what changed in the production method and what you'd notice in taste to indicate the method.

2476,ehdh3c,Need assistance from real amateur wine drinkers,wine,"Long story short: I lost a $125/‚Ç¨110 bet and I want to pay in wine bottles because it would be very appreciated.




The problem is that I'm not sure what quantity to buy.
In my experience the wine industry is infamous for price not correlating with quality. I've had some very expensive bottles of decent wine and some affordable bottles of fantastic wine. That definitely does not help me. With Brandy/whisky/rum I can easily pinpoint if it's a ‚Ç¨20, ‚Ç¨40, or ‚Ç¨80 bottle because the complexity and the smoothness is right there on your tongue. With wine I have no clue.




Do I buy two ‚Ç¨50 bottles, three ‚Ç¨40, or 5 ‚Ç¨20 bottles?
I definitely don't want to buy just one bottle but I don't know how many quality bottles I can get before it's definitely not great wines.




I am mainly interested in French/Italian wine because I'm from Europe and it's easily accessible. Any good bottles or wineries you'd like to mention?"

2482,egzpo1,How to start cellar? Avg bottle price,wine,"Hello All,

I picked up a 200 bottle Eurocave to add to my small 40 bottle fridge. Plan is to see whites and bubbles in the smaller (colder fridge).

I've been buying off Woot, and now Casemates, last bottle wine and WTSO. I tend to buy 4 packs unless I've had the one before. Taste one now, and age the three remaining.

Any suggestions on how to build out a balanced cellar, besides buy what you like. I'm wondering if in getting to heavy in the 20-30$/bottle range and should instead save for more special bottles."

2484,eh2kzi,Floridian growers: consider Sugarloaf mountain?,wine,"Wine grapes need two things: elevation, and a cool season/cool nights. That being said, Florida's only known grape is the Muscadine because the state is not viable to grow standard grape varietals.  


HOWEVER, there might be an exception to this. In South Australia, the weather gets hot and it is the least mountainous of the major viticultural regions. Florida's Sugarloaf mountain seems to resemble some of this geography. Perhaps this should be a descent place to grow Shiraz in the American southeast, since Shiraz loves high alcohol content and high alcohol is a result of heat.  


That being said, this can only be done on a cold year. Florida used to have cool winters, but climate change has shifted this in recent years.   


Just some interesting brainstorming."
2485,egstg0,What determines if a wine can or should be aged?,wine,"I get that certain grape varietals lend themselves better to aging, but can someone explain why that is? For instance, what would happen to a wine that is typically enjoyed young like Zinfandel if you aged it for ~20 years? And along those lines, what is it about wines like Tempranillo that make them age-worthy?"
