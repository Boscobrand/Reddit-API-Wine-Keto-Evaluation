Lighthizer:\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nI am writing as a customer and consumer of imported and domestic wines that is concerned with the multiple rounds of tariffs that are being imposed and considered on wine from the European Union (\\\\u201cEU\\\\u201d). I strongly urge you not to punish me, or my fellow wine lovers, or hardworking wine retailers, for problems we didn\\\\u2019t cause. It\\\\u2019s unfair at face value. You should punish those responsible. Punishing Airbus and their suppliers and French digital services companies would be much more effective, as well as fair.\\\\n\\\\nBeginning on October 18, 2019, the U.S. Government imposed a 25-percent tariff on certain French wine as part of retaliatory tariffs against the European Union (\\\\u201cEU\\\\u201d) after the World Trade Organization authorized retaliation for the EU\\\\u2019s failure to comply with WTO rulings on subsidies provided to Airbus. All the while Airbus itself was only issued a 10% tariff. I understand that a 100-percent tariff is proposed on French sparkling wine (consisting mostly of champagne) and that this tariff is part of the Section 301 duties imposed on imports from France as a result of the country\\\\u2019s Digital Services Tax (\\\\u201cDST\\\\u201d). Finally, on December 10, 2019, USTR proposed imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent on all wines from the EU.\\\\n\\\\nBecause of these import tariffs, the prices will go up dramatically for wine. Margins on wine are extremely small, and the sale of wine is highly regulated, with virtually every state imposing a three-tier distribution system with markups occurring at each tier of distribution. Thus, a 25-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 50-percent increase and a 100-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 150-percent increase in prices for a consumer like me.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nThere is no substitute for imports of wine from the EU. Wines from the EU are different from domestic wines and wines from other countries as a matter of consumer taste. In addition, because it takes many years to plant new grape vineyards and allow the vineyards to produce mature fruit that can be harvested to make wine, it will take at least a decade before the U.S. domestic wine industry could ever be in a position to begin replacing wine imports from the EU.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAs a wine consumer, I do not understand why individual consumers like me and small U.S. businesses should suffer because of a dispute involving Boeing and Airbus or France\\\\u2019s digital services tax. Retaliatory tariffs on these matters should target Airbus and their suppliers who benefitted from the subsidies, and French digital services companies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Click To Email the above letter to the U.S. Trade Representative:**\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=USTR-2019-0003-2518\", \"author_fullname\": \"t2_6o9va\", \"saved\": false, \"mod_reason_title\": null, \"gilded\": 0, \"clicked\": false, \"title\": \"US r/wine-rs.

I know vodka and cokes are technically OK on keto although probably not at the volume I have currently.

      "Update: There are a few people asking about my methods, so I'll go into more detail. The true key to my weight loss was treating the underlying cause, which was depression. I didn't think I suicidal, but I just felt like everyone in my life would be better off without me. I realize now, not only was I suicidal, but I was using food to kill myself. So, along with meds for blood pressure, an A1C of 8.3, and cholesterol, I was given a script for Wellbutrin. This has really been terrific for me, as not only have the bad thoughts gone away, but I'm more motivated to do things, so I'm more active around the house (which the girlfriend appreciates). Once I was medicated, I changed my diet. I tried to be as carnivorous as possible. I bought a Sous Vide machine and a vacuum sealer. This forced me to do meal prep, so once I week I would go to the store and come home and seal up meals for the week. I didn't keep track of macros, but just tried to track my daily carb intake and keep it under 25 per day. I'll eat salads, but now instead of croutons and French dressing I put on parmesan crisps and ranch. The toughest part was giving up pop, even though I only drank diet pop and getting through sugar withdrawals.\n",
