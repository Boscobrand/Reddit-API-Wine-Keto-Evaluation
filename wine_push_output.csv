0,Looking for a summer job,"Hi,

I'm a 23 year-old man from the Netherlands working at a wine bar and busy with the Dutch equivalent of WSET3.

For the summer, I'm looking for a winery (preferably in France or Italy) to work at. I could help with tours, hospitality services or some others jobs if needed. I'm not interested in earning any money, just looking for a place to stay and learn about wine for about two weeks.

7,Any tips on getting out of a wine club...?,"Also posted in /r/legaladvice, but I suspect you guys will have some interesting answers. :) 

I recently moved and joined a wine club through a local shop: every quarter there's a club event with food/drinks and you pick out your wine from multiple local wineries. If you do not attend the event, you get assigned wine from whatever is left over and you pick it up/it's shipped.

My job has unexpectedly involved a lot of travel lately, and I would like to bow out of the club*. I responded to their most recent email - an invitation to the next member event - letting them know I can't attend due to work, and in light of my new job could I please cancel my subscription and hopefully rejoin in the summer when travel will have subsided? I was told ""we can let you skip this one event, but our wine club membership is for one year."" 

If I'm stuck in this club I'll live, of course. But has anyone else successfully extricated themselves from a club...and how? 

*In the event it's important, reasons include: I've missed previous wine club event since joining due to work-related travel for a new job and the event itself was my main reason for joining - so I could make local friends!, my fiance decided to stop drinking wine which makes a club less economical/fun...and frankly, I am not very impressed with the wines they have chosen for me.",wine,1580157659,FriedaKilligan,9,1,True,2020-01-27

SO, I am putting it out into the reddit universe full of folks who know more about I than wine, for any recommendations on what **6x-8x regions / subregions** (and if you desire, specific bottles) you would choose, if you wanted to show off the most broad spectrum of chardonnay possible.

In the past I'd tried to enjoy wine but whenever I tried it, my face scrunched up like a baby trying lemon for the first time. I was sure that I read that if that was the case I should try a sweeter wine, so I got gradually sweeter until I was at port. It was still the same problem.

I did a bit more research this past week and found it likely wasn't the sweetness but the acidity and tartness I was finding unbearable. So I looked in to Merlot. Definitely a marked improvement but I am not sure if it's something I just need to get used to or whether there are practical options for a lower acid red wine type.

I've heard about this a few times and wanted to see what it's all about.

I passed my Intro exam back in 2017. Life has happened since including a new baby, a couple of job changes and more. I feel finally able to double down on my study for the certified exam in July.

I'm working on developing a tasting group in my area of Southern Utah, but it seems that the most regular groups will be in Las Vegas- two hours away. I'll make the travel if necessary so as to work at developing my palate further?

Does anyone have any pointers with regards to study materials, flashcards, and more importantly a regimen that worked for you? I've read plenty of books and study materials, but I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels. How can I make my study for fruitful and efficient?

8,Broke one of my Mark Thomas stems...........,"Never really bothered to fix stemware before, it just goes in the bin, with a brief memorial to all the great service it provided (except for that Riedel Somm Riesling I broke the first time I used it, that pissed me off) but this was different.....

Utterly eceptional glass, head and shoulders above the Zalto Universal, and hands down the best beer glass I've ever used- just does incredible things to the mouthfeel.

Wasn't going to be possible to replace it (sent to NZ from mother in law in Germany) so I thought repair was worth a go. 

Wasn't expecting this to work even vaguely well, it just seemed like a shitty thing ppl do for instagram likes and then toss the glass cos it's acutally all wobbly and useless. Buuuuut, I have to say, as ghetto as it might look, I am pretty impressed with the 'jam it into a cork' strategy. Possibly more effective on finer/lighter glassware, than on the chunkier stuff, I suspect. This has been through the dishwasher a coupla times, and while the cork has expanded, its integrity is unchanged.

Yes, it's a bit wobbly, no I didn't get it quite straight, but that's OK! It LIVES ON.

Used a composite cork (partly as that's what was still lying on the table, partly cos I thought the resinous nature could provide better stability) but I'll def do this again next time I break summin, and try natural cork for comparison.

It's a [Mark Thomas](http://www.markthomas.at/) Double Bend Allround. Also have the Double Bend Red, which gives more fruit presence than the Zalto Burg, and his beer glass, which is amazing for barrel aged beers particularly.

Background: Traveling as a 20 something with lots of travel/food/wine experience but not a huge budget for this short trip. Of note, I'm not really into touristy vineyards but would appreciate more of an agriturismo/local/organic/artisan food type vibe + outstanding wineries who care a lot about their product (but not necessarily top international names).  Because of this, I'm apprehensive to book day trip tours on Viator etc. 

**Where to go/tour recommendations?:** Would obviously prefer to not have to drive since we're on limited time and don't want the hassle, but would like as relaxing and pleasant/value driven of an experience. We're right now most likely going to be based in Florence, and would like some guidance on spending one full day in wine country.

I'm going to start going to a more local shop where I can talk directly to the owner about specific bottles, but even still, what are people's thoughts on buying wine that's more than just 2, 3, 4 years old at a big box retailer? I know Total Wine gets a bit of a bad rap, and locally in Dallas, TX we also have Goody Goody (it's at least only a north Texas chain, not a national one). But anyway, how do we know when a specific bottle was actually released? How long as that store had it? If it's a 2015 released in 2017, have they just had it for 3 years? Stored at room temperature?? I hope not... (As an aside, what's generally the most common amount of time for a winery to bottle age, i.e. time between harvest, barrel, bottle, and release). I've seen things like a 2012 Barolo going for about $40 and I just couldn't bring myself to buy it. I can't imagine that winery held onto that bottle more than 2-3 years, meaning it had potentially been outside of proper storage for 3-4 years (this was in 2019). 

My wife just bought me a bottle of **Maison Denuziere Cote Rotie Les Hauts Lieux 2015** from Total Wine for my birthday and I am ***psyched*** about it.

4,GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS - OLDEST WINE WAS MADE IN GEORGIA,"Good News For Us - Georgians (country)

 Chemical evidence of wine, dating back to 6000‚Äì5800 BC (the early Neolithic period), was obtained from residues of ancient pottery excavated in the archeological sites [of Gadachrili Gora and Shulaveris Gora](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/68379-oldest-wine?fbclid=IwAR2xw0idMsIBQt78q2Z5Bi_7J2ZEZdvEzFd7Zn-O3SYF8qtu-pxiCKGnNG8), about 50 km south of Tbilisi in Georgia. The residues were identified as wine since they contained tartaric acid, which only occurs in large amounts in the Eurasian grape (Vitis vinifera) in the Middle East and the wine made from it. The detection of other organic acids (malic, citric and succinic), also found in the Eurasian grape, provided confirmatory evidence.  


The wine residues were recovered from large-capacity jars, which were probably used for fermentation, ageing and storage. Prior to this discovery, the oldest chemically identified wine from Hajji Firuz Tepe (Iran) dated back to about 5400‚Äì5000 BC. These new findings are from about 600‚Äì1,000 years earlier, and indicate that wine-making and possibly viticulture were already in place about 8,000 years ago.  


The discovery was made by Prof. Patrick McGovern, a molecular archaeologist from the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and lead author of the study ""Early Neolithic Wine of Georgia in the South Caucasus"", published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on 13 November 2017, and scientists from institutions in Georgia, France, Italy, Israel, Canada, Denmark and the USA, who participated in the joint ‚ÄúResearch Project for the Study of Georgian Grapes and Wine Culture"".

We then ordered two steaks, both dry aged for 36 months. One was a fillet and other rib eye on the bone, with sides. Then came the wine. 

Far out what a wine - after 2 hours decanting this showed off in a big way: plums, fresh mint, orange slices, mixed herbs, fine tannin, acidity in check and long length in the every sip. Perfect with the steaks.

1. Stand them at room temp 
2. Give up wine fridge space and make a custom shelf to hold bottles upright.
3. Wine-cradles / Don't stand 
4. Suck it up and but an extra fridge.

Standing at room temp isn't viable here as it gets way too hot for most of the year to let the stand for that long.

Wine-fridge space is doable, but frustrating as cuts down on options I can store at home and has me fighting my offsite too much. On the plus side as long as I don't stand too much I might have room for the decanter in the fridge.

2,Questions about buying mid-tier red Burgundy,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

After having enjoyed a regular red burgundy from 2017 and a C√¥te de Nuits-Villages from 2012 I'd like to try either a great village wine (maybe Fixin or Vosne-Roman√©e?) or a premier cru from the C√¥te de Nuits. While it was easy to find a good quality regular red burg and a good C√¥te de Nuits-Villages, I have no idea what to look for in a high-quality village wine or a premier cru. 

Are Vivino ratings an improtant thing to look for and should I buy something online with a high rating or should I walk into my local wine store and ask them to help me pick a bottle? Are vintages very important and should I skip 2013 or isn't it that important?

I've also heard that one of the main things that distinguishes good red burgundy wines is the ability to improve over age, so should I only look for older vintages or will newer ones also be worth the money?

And one last question, in what way do young premier cru wines differ from young village ones? Is it just an improvement of the wine's balance of flavours or is there also added complexity (even though both wines are young)?

Some producers that I have access to include Drouhin, Domaine Robert Sirugue, Domaine Huguenot, Domaine Chopin, JC Boisset and Vougeraie (but I could also try find some Meo Camuzet online).

What I'm finding though is the lack of knowledge in the boutique stores is frustrating. This past week I had a woman telling me that wine was from ""the Russian River AVA, whatever AVA means"". And when I explained I was looking to compare oaked vs. unoaked  examples of a grape and was thinking of a Napa chardonnay versus a Chablis, she asked: ""Why not get two chardonnay?""

I‚Äôve got a lot of questions and I‚Äôd appreciate any responses you‚Äôre willing to give. Or if you want to DM that works too. 



How did you start in the wine business?


Do you import and distribute to on/off premise or import and supply distributors?


Did/does your business have a central theme or focus(other than making money) - such as a focus on Loire/Burgundy/piedmont/natural etc. 


Did you start with a group of producers from one region or several regions/countries?


What is something you wish you had known or started early in the life of the business?


What was your biggest challenge besides selling all of your products?


How prohibitive was governmental red tape?


How difficult was it to find proper shipping partners?


How long after starting was your company profitable?


Did you start with multiple employees or just yourself?

6,Calling Australian wine lovers [ADVICE],"What are the best wines available here at decent prices? Foreign or local. Please let‚Äôs reserve answers to actual Australians as the aim is to find wines cheap on the Australian market.

In the way of local wines, I like the Tahbilk Marsanne because it is affordable ($12) and lovely‚Äîif you decant it! It has a honeysuckle flavour that sits in a really interesting way against the minerality. It‚Äôs one-dimensional and sharp if it doesn‚Äôt have the chance to breathe before it‚Äôs drunk though! I also like the De Bortoli Cuv√©e Blanc for its relative price compared to its quality. It‚Äôs not a perfect, or even a great sparkling wine, but it‚Äôs $17 and you won‚Äôt see much that‚Äôs anything near the same quality at that price in Australia. The Stonier Pinot ($20 IIRC) is lovely as well but it‚Äôs for those who prefer the more subtle, watery type of pinot‚ÄîI like the translucent feel but for those who like stronger tastes it could seem a bit dilute. The Turkey Flat Ros√© is pretty lovely as well, it‚Äôs a cliche by now though.

I‚Äôd love to hear from others who have tried a couple of different wines and formed some sort of view. Also interested to hear about some more expensive wines (as in $40-100) because I don‚Äôt have the chance to taste them generally, but if there‚Äôs one that‚Äôs very well-regarded enough I could justify putting a bit extra towards them.

Edit: is there any person who can recommend specifically a sweet Australian sparkling wine? (As in the non-Champagne equivalent to demi-sec/semi-dry.) I don‚Äôt care about the price.",wine,1579015079,9IrVFQoly6yMi6,7,1,True,2020-01-14

All of them had a really interesting (and consistent) insider view on Rioja wines. In their view, the classic Crianza, Reserva, Gran Reserva is great for quality control (you know how much time in oak they've spent) but it also shackles their creativity a bit. Mind you, I drank plenty of amazing ""red label"" Rioja in Spain, and they've always a treat, but when they wanted to share their ""best stuff,"" in almost every instance they reached for something with a green label, meaning it did not qualify as one of the typical classifications. They often used different oak, or less oak, or, in one case, aged it in amphora. Alternatively, they showcased some of their eccentric younger wines, ones that were complex but exhibited a much more fruit-forward experience than the typical Rioja. One winemaker summed it up like this: drinking a gran reserva is like listening to Frank Sinatra, drinking this (green label wine) is like listening to Frank Ocean. One is classic, one is new-age, both have merits.

2013 Blanc - Surely one of the best whites to come from Bordeaux. So refreshing with this tropical lime, white flowers and fresh cream profile, fine acidity and length. Vanished quickly.   


We didn't taste these in any particular order - just poured out and tried side by side to each other.   


1998 - Creme brulee, white flowers, apricot, pineapple. Medium bodied and not rich like other vintages. Super complex. Big tick for me, my kind of Sauternes.   


2005 - Wild nose. Honey, almond, pear juice. Again, the complexity will slow you down drinking this in the best way possible. A lighter tasting style again. Very good.   


1987 - Orange, flowers, some herbal vibes - pretty straight forward. It was okay, didn't really excite me.

Hi there,   


My name is Aaron, as my thread title says I am a Senior Sommelier of 10 years, and 7 months ago became a Dad, so I moved into IT during the day to be home of an evening - though I still love wine and still wanted to be a part of it somehow. I always get asked at work for wine recommendations, and being a guest myself at different places of late I was left disappointed by the service - so I believe strongly there is room in the world for something like this.  


Way it works is simple - you message me on Whatsapp where you are eating (if outside of Australia, please provide state/country), what you mainly plan to eat, style of wine you want (bubbly, white, red? Sweet, dry, light, full?) and price range approx - then leave the rest to me! I look up the menu online, and if not available, I'll ask for a photo of the wine page that interests you.  


As this is a new idea, it is currently free to use. If you do use it, would appreciate if you share this with your friends and any feedback.   


Important to note I am from Australia, so if you are from a different timezone to me (like EU/US) then there will be a delay in me getting back to you - so thanks for waiting and I will get back asap.

5,A tip for all future wine tourists in the Rhine region (Germany),"I was just travelling from South to North by train and realized that this might be a cool idea for everyone who has never been to this beautiful region before (especially us wine enthusiasts ;) -- if you want to see the most pictoresque/scenic part of the Rhine and the most important wine growing area along this river, just book a train ticket from Mainz to Koblenz (or in the opposite direction) and make sure that it is the EC train (Euro City, usually from Zurich to Hamburg; NOT the ICE which runs through a tunnel) -- this is the important part!! Then book a seat at the window front and make sure you travel during the day (when there is light) -- the train travels directly through the Rhine valley and passes all those beautiful spots like the Loreley, a hundred castles and ALL of the vineyards on the surrounding steep hills. A great experience that never get's old and is so cheap that you have more money left for the lots of good wine you want to take home with you ;)

The first is a Broccoli Cottage ""Cannelloni"". Recipe: https://divaliciousrecipes.com/broccoli-ricotta-cannelloni/ . We will use cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

The second is a Cauliflower Pork Fried Rice. Recipe: https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/cauliflower-pork-fried-rice/

0,Question for those who have started collecting,"To preface: 
Last year while on vacation our hotel room was robbed - and we didn‚Äôt have great information on what we had with us to provide evidence to insurance for reimbursement. 
So this year we have been electronically cataloguing what‚Äôs in our -owned- home - what the items are, photos, and any evidence of purchase along with a link to the item for cost valuation. 

Finalizing all this is a question regarding Home Ownership and what it covers - 
I‚Äôve started collecting wines that I enjoy, roughly 150 bottles so far, and have them in the basement in racks. I am tracking these in CellarTracker in addition to the above method. 

Now if something were to happen to the house: does your home owners insurance cover your cellar or do people have an additional rider? I don‚Äôt have $100.000+ worth of wine so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd need to but wanted to put out the question to others.

6,1982 Lafite-Rothschild.,"Thought I‚Äôd share some stories behind wines tried previously. To start things off, ‚Äò82 Lafite! In my previous life as a corporate and private wine consultant one of my clients was a boat charter company - after building a strong relationship with them, they would go on to refer me unknowingly to what would be my biggest private client. After months of emails and phone calls for wine orders and recommendations for dinners they would have, I got invited over as this persons Housekeeper wanted my opinion on their cellar. I would spend the next few days creating a spreadsheet of everything they had - stuff to drink now, throw out and keep with recommended drinking windows. It was an extensive list that went into the hundreds of items and would take me a month to finish properly with researching bottles. I sent the spreadsheet off and didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a fortnight. Eventually the housekeeper got back to me and couldn‚Äôt believe the data within it, and asked to send an invoice. I replied back it was no charge (they were already spending crazy amounts for dinner parties and gifts). I didn‚Äôt hear anything back for a week and got invited over to theirs again for coffee and lunch - and that‚Äôs when this wine came out. It would be the first of a number of crazy ones I had only ever read about, yet here I was now having them at this persons house. For lunch, it was some ham and salad rolls! The wine of course is what you would expect from such a name and vintage and perfectly cellared - powerful, fresh blue fruit still present with a deep blue jam flavour, graphite and a smoked wood flavour. The finish lasted minutes. Crazy wine.

Hi! I work at a liquor store in sw Missouri! I love my job, as it works really well with my school schedule.

I do love wine, but I'm learning. I dont know nearly as much as my coworkers do about it.

My boss took that, and decided that I should run the wine room! So here I am, a total beer guy... with his own wine room...

I havent tasted much wine and I dont have the budget to just buy a bunch right now. I'm also just not really familiar with how to help potential customers. In my beer section, I've had most of what people ask about, so helping is usually pretty easy. But if someone were to ask me the differences between different sav' blancs, I know that I would just be a bumbling idiot. 

I know some of you will say ""just do your best and try stuff and make your own opinions as you go!"", which I will absolutely be doing! But I just need some help.

* write down all details of the wine in my notebook (including bottle description/alcohol content etc).

* Smell the wine in the bottle then decant and swirl and let it breathe.

* Smell and compare to the previous sniff of wine in the bottle. 

* Pour into a large wine glass, swirl and sniff 5/6 times.

* Drink and swirl around mouth 

* for each sip I focus on one thing e.g. Acidity, body, length etc and jot down what I notice. 

* I then jot down an overall review of what I actually thought (e.g. bit tart for my liking but might go well with food etc).

* Give it another smell and taste as I often find I smell things I didn't catch before after a short break (or it's just oxidized properly because I'm impatient)

* then browse /r/wine and spend my monthly wages on suggested wines! /s

0,**MWC Experimental Series #1! January 2020 Selection Post!**,"Hello everyone and Happy New year!  I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season, and welcome to the January installment of the Monthly Wine Challenge! Thanks to some wonderful dialogue in the last couple of months, I felt that with the new year, it is time to try something new for the MWC.  For the most part, there won't be much of a difference.  I'm still going to hold to the format of region and grape.  But I'm also going to switch it up from time to time, and I'm hoping that this will stop the stagnation that has been plaguing us lately.  I'm going to be calling this the Experimental Series, inspired by a series of scotch that my dad has from the Glenfiddich distillery.  And with that, there is no time like the present.  So, with that  in mind, lets discover what this month has in store for us:  


**Grape:** Pinot Noir  
**Country and Region #1:** USA, Pacific North West  
**Country and Region #2:** New Zealand, Any  


Thats right!  Not one, but TWO regions this month!  I've always wanted to try to include comparative tastings to the MWC, but until now, I was unsure how to do it.  So, for the first entry into the MWC Experimental Series, I have decided on pinot noir from the PNW of the US, with one from anywhere in New Zealand.  As I am not very familiar with either region, I felt this was a good place to start.  Feel free to post notes for multiple bottles.  If you have 2 from one region and one from another, go ahead!  Can only find one region, and not the other, thats ok to.  Just post what notes you have.  Otherwise, the format will not be much different from previous challenges.    


So, just like with past MWC entries, us on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.), and e) if you preferred one style over the other.

If you are new to wine tasting, [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/2015/08/25/how-to-taste-wine/) has a great article to get you going.  Have fun choosing your wine, and I will see you all on the 15th!

See you on the 15th!  If you have suggestions for future comparative tastings, or just a suggestion for one of our regular tastings, please feel free to message me.  And as a reminder, if you have not posted your notes from the December 2019 Challenge, you will be able to do so in this thread until January 7th.",wine,1577918139,PhoenixRising20,20,1,True,2020-01-01
1,Aroma trainer or courses?,"Hi all,

My wife told me to pick a wine class I wanted to attend as a Christmas present.  Having read a lot and knowing what I""m good at (acidity, alcohol, identifying oak, earth aromas, and general wine knowledge) and what I'm bad at (fruit aromas and floral aromas), I was wondering if a wine aroma kit might be a better investment.

I'm good at identifying oak and general wine structure, but more than a little embarrassed, that I don't get raspberry rather than just ""general fruit"".  I can get barnyard, earthy, mushroom, but rose vs. marigold or strawberry vs blackberry and I'm just guessing.  Weird thing is, I taste a lot better than I smell.  Okay, that sounded bad . . . uh, my sense of taste of those things is much better than me trying to smell them before drinking.

I've read good things about Le Nez du Vin, but man that's expensive ($400).  I thought about doing my own, but I have a lot of other time commitments.  So a kit is probably worth it.  Maybe?

What are your all's thoughts on courses versus the aroma kits?  Anybody done the WSET2 or 3 stuff?  Recommend an aroma kit?

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Chickpea Cauliflower Eggplant Tomato Stew. Recipe: http://eastvanvegan.com/eggplant-chickpea-tagine-vegan-gf/ Website appears to be down but the ingredients are listed. Harissa, chili, mint, parsley as seasonings.

The second is a Meatloaf with Sauteed Cabbage, Leek and Celeriac Fries. Recipes: https://www.karlasnordickitchen.com/skillet-meatloaf-with-sauteed-cabbage/ and https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/celeriac-chips/

1,Need assistance from real amateur wine drinkers,"Long story short: I lost a $125/‚Ç¨110 bet and I want to pay in wine bottles because it would be very appreciated.




The problem is that I'm not sure what quantity to buy.
In my experience the wine industry is infamous for price not correlating with quality. I've had some very expensive bottles of decent wine and some affordable bottles of fantastic wine. That definitely does not help me. With Brandy/whisky/rum I can easily pinpoint if it's a ‚Ç¨20, ‚Ç¨40, or ‚Ç¨80 bottle because the complexity and the smoothness is right there on your tongue. With wine I have no clue.




Do I buy two ‚Ç¨50 bottles, three ‚Ç¨40, or 5 ‚Ç¨20 bottles?
I definitely don't want to buy just one bottle but I don't know how many quality bottles I can get before it's definitely not great wines.

Florida's Sugarloaf mountain seems to resemble some of this geography. Perhaps this should be a descent place to grow Shiraz in the American southeast, since Shiraz loves high alcohol content and high alcohol is a result of heat.

Nose: Immensely dense and compley. At first, loads of red and dark fruit. Ripe cherries, blackberries, plums, blueberries.. Then, with swirling, olives, laurel berry leaves, tobacco and leather. I spent over 10 minutes with just sniffing.

Palate: It's like a fruit tsunami overwhelming yor. Needs some time to identify all the aromes, because there are so many. Everyhing I got in the nose is also present on the palate, with a great clarity and precision. It's like looking on the many facings of a diamond that changes its appearens when you turn it around in the light. The acidity and density is amazing, the 15,5% feel like 13,5%. The wine is at the same time overwhelming and elegant. The finish is basically endless, adding on the primary notes salty caramel, leather, burnt almonds, cinnamon and eucalyptus. Despite the complexity it screams for the next sip.

Score: 97/100, I agree with the high parker scores on this winery.

5,Weird experience with Riesling,"Sorry if this isn‚Äôt a normal post for this sub, but my SO and I are dying to solve this. 

My SO (we‚Äôll call her Oli) and I were at a super nice restaurant in Denver and while we‚Äôve both had a fair share of wine, we had never had Riesling before. She decided to give it a shot and ordered a glass of belle pente Riesling from willamette valley 2009. At first, the wine was fantastic! It was very sweet and smooth and encouraged me to order a glass. 

But after this first sip is when we became completely lost in what was going on. 

Oli noticed something in her glass (small piece of sweater lint maybe) and pulled it out with her knife.  She wasn‚Äôt worried about whatever it was and didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss. But, after taking whatever it was out, the wine took on a completely new flavor. A new strangely acidic/chemical taste completely overpowered the wines original flavor. 

This obviously spurred her to order a new glass, with our best theory being the metal of the knife effected the flavor in some way we were too unknowledgeable to understand. My glass arrived with her new one, and thus our confusion continued to pile up. 

Both of our glasses had this weird new flavor that the original sip did not have in any way. At a complete loss, we googled Riesling to make sure we weren‚Äôt being dumb about the experience of really nice wines. What we found on google was this as the top result: ‚ÄúRiesling is a white grape variety which originated in the Rhine region. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines.‚Äù - from Wikipedia

So here‚Äôs my question for you wine aficionados here on r/wine, are we uncultured in wines (especially nicer ones like Riesling) or did we have an experience that is clearly not what is supposed to happen?

Normally I'd assume that it was a problem with aging, but I find this true of wines with perfect provenance, including wines from very nice restaurants with very high price tags (expensive FG Bordeaux, etc...).

Some of my favorite values are:

White:


-PYCM Bourgogne Blanc: A rather well-made wine and an excellent introduction to the house style. His Pernand-Vergelesses wines also punch well above their weight and can sometimes be found under $50. I feel that PYCM's wines are a good example of the importance of winemaking and terroir; though with the lesser wines you miss out on the terroir, his signature is still there (and I happen to love it).


Red:


-Hudelot-No√´llat Bourgogne Rouge: A beautiful introduction to red burgundy, all red-fruited elegance and grace. While lacking some depth, it's simply a delicious wine -- another example where I just love the style.


Also, recently I tried a 2016 Domaine Bart Marsannay and was not expecting much -- it was a producer I had never heard of from a lesser village. However, this wine really outperformed. At first a bit closed, but this opened up to reveal a deeply dark-fruited wine with striking purity. A strong mineral backbone and streak of acidity along with a tight tannic structure implies that this will benefit from some cellar time. Was really impressed by this wine.",wine,1577465010,BP-IB,12,1,True,2019-12-27

Re: Opposition to Tariffs on Imported Wine from the European Union

 

Dear Amb. Lighthizer:

 

I am writing as a customer and consumer of imported and domestic wines that is concerned with the multiple rounds of tariffs that are being imposed and considered on wine from the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù). I strongly urge you not to punish me, or my fellow wine lovers, or hardworking wine retailers, for problems we didn‚Äôt cause. It‚Äôs unfair at face value. You should punish those responsible. Punishing Airbus and their suppliers and French digital services companies would be much more effective, as well as fair.

Beginning on October 18, 2019, the U.S. Government imposed a 25-percent tariff on certain French wine as part of retaliatory tariffs against the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù) after the World Trade Organization authorized retaliation for the EU‚Äôs failure to comply with WTO rulings on subsidies provided to Airbus. All the while Airbus itself was only issued a 10% tariff. I understand that a 100-percent tariff is proposed on French sparkling wine (consisting mostly of champagne) and that this tariff is part of the Section 301 duties imposed on imports from France as a result of the country‚Äôs Digital Services Tax (‚ÄúDST‚Äù). Finally, on December 10, 2019, USTR proposed imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent on all wines from the EU.

Because of these import tariffs, the prices will go up dramatically for wine. Margins on wine are extremely small, and the sale of wine is highly regulated, with virtually every state imposing a three-tier distribution system with markups occurring at each tier of distribution. Thus, a 25-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 50-percent increase and a 100-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 150-percent increase in prices for a consumer like me.

 

There is no substitute for imports of wine from the EU. Wines from the EU are different from domestic wines and wines from other countries as a matter of consumer taste. In addition, because it takes many years to plant new grape vineyards and allow the vineyards to produce mature fruit that can be harvested to make wine, it will take at least a decade before the U.S. domestic wine industry could ever be in a position to begin replacing wine imports from the EU.

 

As a wine consumer, I do not understand why individual consumers like me and small U.S. businesses should suffer because of a dispute involving Boeing and Airbus or France‚Äôs digital services tax. Retaliatory tariffs on these matters should target Airbus and their suppliers who benefitted from the subsidies, and French digital services companies.

7,I'm looking for the perfect gift for my father.,"First of all, this is my first post in this subreddit, I love how there's such a nice community for something so old and wonderful as wine. Now, I need a piece of advice from you. I'm a young Spanish guy that discovered some month ago that his father ""secretly"" started a rather curious collection.

My father wants to collect (Football-cards-album style) the ""stickers"" (front and back labels on the bottle) of each one of Spanish wine designations of origin, let me explain: in Spain there are a certain number of certificated wine producers, each one of them with their own ""Name"", ""Brand"" and designation of origin that they share with other wine producers of the same region.

And the thing is, that my father wants at least one of those bottles to add to it's collection, Imagine that in the region of MADRID there are 2 designations of origin with 6 different wine producers, so my father need 2 bottles, one for each designation of origin of the region of MADRID. You can find more and better information about this in this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_wine_regions) webpage.

Now, what's the problem? I have no idea what to do.

I would like to help my father to complete his collection with a nice gift (I have to add the fact that in Spain we have another Christmas-gifts-and-presents-situation on January 6th, more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi)). Here are some of my first ideas:

I have been thinking about buying a bottle from one of the 2 archipelagos of Spain: Balearic and Canary Islands, it's seems like those islands have their own designations of origin that are very hard to find in the Spanish peninsula (where we live), so I think it would be a nice present, the thing is that I have no idea which should I pick.

Also, while looking through Amazon I discovered the concept of ""Submarine Wines"" that it seems like it's quite a thing in Spain. The bottles looks so cool and unique with all the sea stuff attached to it, here is an [example](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07KVJQYT6/ref=sspa_dk_detail_2?psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWkFWQjRGT0pZNFdTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjkzNDgzWU02Q0ZYSkdRSEpJJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzNDkyOTgzTFZSUDM5QlRIWjlNJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsMiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) .

And my last thought was trying to look for any kind of accessory or tool that would help my father get the stickers from the bottle. I did a bit of detective work while he was sleeping and I have been taking some pictures of how it's he doing it. It's seems like he submerges the bottles in just water for a couple of days, then with a razor blade he extract the stickers, with the little glue left in the stickers it paste them in some kitchen-super-dry-paper and let them dry for some hours, then he puts them in his folder.

The pictures I took:

*Processing img lr75m6b6lz641...*

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img hnjt6ev8lz641...*

  

*Processing img 2ew8xo6blz641...*

It's seems like he wants to get more stickers before making any kind of sorting by type, year or designations of origin, by now he's just stacking them together in the folder.

Additional information: My father it's not a crazy wine drinker, he drinks very casually, not everyday. Also, as a lot of you would know wine in Spain is very cheap, we do not live in a mansion or drive expensive cars, the most expensive wine he have bought for the collection was around 21‚Ç¨, being said that I wouldn't mind spending 50‚Ç¨ in a bottle of wine for my father (like the submarine bottle linked before) but more expensive than that... don't think so.

So that's the situation right now, I would like to know your opinion on all of this, what do you think It would be a nice gift for him!

(2) Yogurt Beet Pumpkin Pizza (Recipe: https://www.blueberryvegan.com/en/winterliche-knusprige-pizzaschiffchen-mit-kuerbis-rote-bete-und-gruenkohl/). Again, we'll likely drop or replace the kale (with spinach?) and perhaps add feta for some added protein/flavour.

So three questions:

1. is a Chardonnay a good choice for these meals?

2. Are my estimated DBDs accurate?

3. Which chardonnay would match best with which dish?",wine,1577283943,Kalenden,6,1,True,2019-12-25

For a side dish I'm having couscous with Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, dried apricots, raisins and fried onions.

Anyway, I'm considering a Beaujolais Cru to pair with the food, since I've heard Beaujolais/light reds pair well with turkey, and trust me, salted cod as well - ask the Portuguese people! So although I'm considering a white for that (I already have a white in mind), I think I'm gonna trust the Portuguese and serve a red. Besides, I don't think a white would pair well with ham. So, Beaujolais it is. I hope it works :)

So the question is about which Cru to choose...

I have been using my own at my current job since we opened in August.  And to guests, its great!  People ask, ""Ive seen those, but never knew how they worked"" or ""Ive never seen an opener like that."" 

I was showing an employee how to use it a few weeks ago, and she cracked the neck of a bottle.

Yesterday, i chipped the lip of a bottle, and was told i cant use my Ahso anymore.

I have decided to get into the world of vintage port, a decision largely based on my love for the drink and the relative cheapness of the product.

However, rather than having it in a cool dry place, it has been in my bedroom (I live in the UK) which can be slightly warm over the summer but much cooler in the winter (i.e. now). It is in a box on the bottle of a bookshelf type affair.

My question it, is there a way to tell if this is now ruined and what is my best course of action for the bottle going forward? I know I need to store it for 20 years+ but I just don't know if I should now abandon this particular bottle.

Tariffs - are you ok with paying double for your wine?
SHARE 
I love December in the wine shop ‚Äì it‚Äôs extra busy, and it‚Äôs a lot of fun. But there‚Äôs a shadow hanging over this holiday season for all wine lovers: the very good possibility that our government will apply tariffs to wine from all EU countries, simultaneously increasing the existing tariffs (currently imposed on French, Spanish, and German wine) to 100% of the importer‚Äôs cost (or 100% of your cost if you buy some bottles on holiday in Rome and bring them home with you)*. This is so disastrous that the consequences are hard to wrap my head around, but it looks life-threatening. David Lillie and I have spent 18 years building our business, and it could get wiped out in one blow; for better or worse we‚Äôve tied our love of European wine to the life of our shop.  We have 25 employees, many with families; we pay their health insurance; we pay a boatload of taxes. Chambers Street Wines is a micro business, but there are many thousands of employees and owners around the country who will be similarly affected ‚Äì to say nothing of how this will impact our wine loving customers.

We are told again and again that the number of citizens heard from matters to those who make such decisions. Whatever you think in general regarding the strategy and motivation behind the imposition of tariffs, we hope you will join us in pushing back against the imposition of 100% tariffs on wine.* Please follow the links below to send messages to the decision makers involved.

*almost all consumer goods produced in the EU will be subject to the new tariffs. Like me you may not consume much in the way of leather goods, but we eat a lot of olive oil, pasta, cheese‚Ä¶.

Below are links to prepared statements that you can easily send - but of course feel free to create your own diatribe! Thank you for taking the time. We'll keep our fingers crossed. Jamie Wolff &amp; David Lillie

                        Re: Opposition to Tariffs on Imported Wine from the European Union

Dear Amb. Lighthizer:

I am writing as a customer and consumer of imported and domestic wines who is concerned with the multiple rounds of tariffs that are being imposed and considered on wine from the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù).  I strongly urge you not to punish me, or my fellow wine lovers, or hardworking wine importers and retailers for problems we didn‚Äôt cause. It‚Äôs unfair at face value. You should punish those responsible. Punishing Airbus and their suppliers and French digital services companies would be much more effective, as well as fair. 

Beginning on October 18, 2019, the U.S. Government imposed a 25-percent tariff on certain French wine as part of retaliatory tariffs against the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù) after the World Trade Organization authorized retaliation for the EU‚Äôs failure to comply with WTO rulings on subsidies provided to Airbus. All the while Airbus itself was only issued a 10% tariff. I understand that a 100% tariff is proposed on French sparkling wine (consisting mostly of Champagne) and that this tariff is part of the Section 301 duties imposed on imports from France as a result of the country‚Äôs Digital Services Tax (‚ÄúDST‚Äù). Finally, on December 10, 2019, USTR proposed imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent on all wines from the EU. 

Because of these import tariffs, the prices will go up dramatically for wine. Margins on wine are extremely small, and the sale of wine is highly regulated, with virtually every state imposing a three-tier distribution system with markups occurring at each tier of distribution.  Thus, a 25-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 50-percent increase and a 100-percent tariff on wine imports will likely result in a 150-percent increase in prices for a consumer like me.

There is no substitute for imports of wine from the EU. Wines from the EU are different from domestic wines and wines from other countries as a matter of consumer taste.  In addition, because it takes many years to plant new grape vineyards and allow the vineyards to produce mature fruit that can be harvested to make wine, it will take at least a decade before the U.S. domestic wine industry could ever be in a position to begin replacing wine imports from the EU.

As a wine consumer, I do not understand why individual consumers like me should suffer because of a dispute involving Boeing and Airbus or France‚Äôs digital services tax.  Retaliatory tariffs on these matters should target Airbus and their suppliers who benefitted from the subsidies or French digital services companies.",wine,1576856684,redaniel,63,1,True,2019-12-20

0,Trip Report: Mostly Barcelona with a bit of Madrid and Toledo,"The fiance and I had the good fortune to burn a flight travel voucher to Spain for a week. We like wine so ended up at a few places worth mentioning for future posterity. Turns out, wine culture in Spain is just as awesome as you'd expect. And it is very accessible for those without big budgets. 

We didn't do any ""wine touring"" per se -- just drinking glasses at bars, and a few bottles at home along the way. This is more of a post on the places and their wine focus than tasting notes on any wine in particular. 

**Barcelona**

* [La Catalista](https://www.lacatalista.com/) . This was our first stop after arriving in Barcelona. It was raining, our AirBnB host was running late, so we walked 50 steps to the closest bar we could find. We ended up coming back for at least a glass every day for the remainder of our trip. It's a wine bar owned by an American ex-pat serving exclusively Catalan wine along with some seriously good food. Focus is on smaller producers making low-intervention wine, especially with less than common local varieties. My first wine there was an a fun off-dry, oxidative white made with [Malvasia de Sitges](https://i.imgur.com/p1PF4Nf.jpg) that was super delicious. Other memorable bits included this [gran reserve cava with cerviche](https://i.imgur.com/qKiFETE.jpg). (And the sumoll in the background was the first time I'd ever heard of or tried that grape.) An example of their [rotating wild card menu](https://i.imgur.com/czZPfgh.jpg) . Overall just a fun little wine bar with a super friendly staff who likes local, well-made wine.
* [Quimet y Quimet](https://www.quimetquimet.com/): Dinner our first night. Yes its busy, yes there are tourists, yes there are locals. They are a bit pushy, but damn was everything we ate tasty. We started with their homemade \[vermouth and Quimet y Quimet beer\]([https://i.imgur.com/YlC6UoI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YlC6UoI.jpg)) before sharing some cava and a few more appetizers. Nice thing is you can buy [anything off the wall](https://i.imgur.com/MyxfEnh.jpg) at very reasonable prices to have with your delicious food. No we didn't drink Vina Tondonia.
* [La Graciosa](https://www.facebook.com/lagraciosabcn/): Definitely a nerdy and serious place for natural wine lovers. Lots of funky weird stuff, but didn't take themselves too seriously. Only remembered to snap a pic of the [whites we drank](https://i.imgur.com/7orxNQZ.jpg). Wish we could've stayed longer but they had an event about to start which included a bunch of unlabeled bottles being pulled out of suitcases. If you're into the natty side of natural wine this is your place. 
* [Bar Salvatge](https://barsalvatge.com/): This is what happens when natty wine goes mainstream. Loud, popular environment. Ten wines available on tap in different levels of fritzy and fruity to brett-bombs. Not to my taste but an interesting riff to see what happens when this style of natural wines make it to a non-wine nerd crowd who just likes a new approach and feeling to a wine bar. 
* [La Vinya del Senyor](https://www.facebook.com/vinyadelsenyor/): Stumbled across this place wandering around the neighborhood, and what a delight. Nice outside patio, cozy inside, great seafood and great variety of classic wines by the glass. Not the cheapest place, but compared to what you spend in the US, still a bargin. Oh, and if you like sherry -- they've got a full page of it by the glass. This [manzanilla and oyster pairing](https://i.imgur.com/91SwDvO.jpg) was the pairing of the trip for me. They also had quite the selection of wines on Coravin allowing you taste some spendier bottles like this [local elegant and powerful merlot blend](https://i.imgur.com/nb3BS11.jpg). 
* [Boedga Maestrazgo](http://bodegamaestrazgo.com/): [Half bottle shop, half wine bar.](https://i.imgur.com/tzg1A4T.jpg) Everything from very inexpensive (3euro/liter) bulk wine to go, to a whole range of quality producers. Super friendly staff. We drank glasses of this [very nicely acidic bierzo](https://i.imgur.com/7cBmPTz.jpg) that reminded us of cab franc from the Loire which is one of our go to faves. Highly recommend a stop here for a bottle to go, to get mix for sangria, and a glass along the way. We grabbed an inexpensive (15euro?) bottle of 2010 reserva cava for [our picnic the next day.](https://i.imgur.com/5gwpSmT.jpg)
* [Bar Brutal](http://cancisa.cat/): The older sibling of Bar Salvatge and one we enjoyed a good bit more. More toned down from full on natty. Night we happened in was a tasting of Christian Tschida wines -- with [not quite-full pours of 5 cuvees](https://i.imgur.com/py1F6Gc.jpg) for 15 euros a pop.  Somms here were eager to talk about each one and just seemed to really be enjoying their nights. Tons of regulars mixed in with the many tourists you always find in this bit of town.

and we saved the big dog for the final night

* [Monvinic](http://www.monvinic.com/): This place is serious. Huge lists, awesome by the glass selection. Quiet atmosphere and very focused customers. A very different vibe, service not eager to explain things to you as perhaps they assume you already know a good bit. The ipad based lists are impressive and--frankly--necessary for navigating. We tasted through 8 half glasses, had some simple tapas (bread and cheese) and were out for about 60euro. Started with [two very different whites](https://i.imgur.com/OuYzuq8.jpg) \-- the muscat being just so pretty, fresh and full of flowers. On to some local reds -- [a small batch sumoll and a marselan](https://i.imgur.com/ReFq2Dm.jpg). The marselan -- a grape I hadn't been exposed to -- was the standout here as bringing just the right amount of cab sauv seriousness to the fruit profile. A bottle I'll certainly look for in the future. Then two more Spanish -- a sulphur and white-pepper nosed [red from the Canary islands](https://i.imgur.com/LTPz2Db.jpg), followed up by a powerful, smooth and just-the-right-amount-of-oak [gran reserva rioja.](https://i.imgur.com/iikjexf.jpg) That was supposed to be the end of it, but we decided we had time for two more wines which generally would be outside our budget. So we had a glass of [1er cru Burgundy](https://i.imgur.com/N2WvbGR.jpg) (which reminded me why I can't drink Burgundy often because I'll fall in love as it just tastes to me like some mental platonic ideal of wine in my head, and I can't afford it). And then finished on a [2012 Pomerol](https://i.imgur.com/0ahOQv7.jpg) \-- the fiance's favorite of the night. 

**Toledo**

* No wine bars to mention but we bought this bottle of ""#Garagewine"" on a whim at a [well stocked local shop](http://casacuartero.com/). After drinking overly-young-overly-oak Rioja for a few days, this was the expression of local cencibel ( Tempranillo ) I needed: medium bodied, fruit forward, plenty of acid, lots of cherries. 

**Madrid**

* [Vino y Compania](http://vinoycompania.blogspot.com/): A small neighborhood wine shop right around the door from our place. Super friendly staff, big selections in every price range, focused on smaller producers. We had a [few tasty bottles from there](https://i.imgur.com/daGkr5w.jpg) (and one great bottle of ""cuvee"" saison from a nearby beer shop.)
* [La Venencia](https://goo.gl/maps/VHSr1vPCSNMrv8Sm7): Prior to this trip I'd had sherry maybe twice in my life, prior to fancy dinners in England. I was young, it wasn't memorable. This place is going to be to blame for a new habit. Holy shit is it what my palate needed after a bunch of oaked Riojas. Sherry only, all of it straight from the cask. Fino and Manzanilla for 1.80euro,  Amontillado, Oloroso, Palo Cortado for 2.20euro per pour. Simple tapas including the best free olives you'll get anywhere. The vibrancy and slightly yeasty characteristics of fino were tops for me but all were just so new to my taste buds that it was hard to process. No tipping, [no pictures](https://i.imgur.com/HC1h2jB.jpg) (yes I failed, that's our tab). We had a drink here in the afternoon, then came back and closed the place down that night. The fiance and I have an expression for when we find a place we want to melt into for a long time: ""I live here now."" I said that about La Venecia from the 3rd day of our trip when we found it, til we left 6 days later from Barcelona.

Hope this can be of use to future wine travelers to these cities, and would love to read about other places local wine scenes.

I've done a bit of searching and the Wine Bible seems to be oft recommended, however seems to be more focused on history, geography and other information about wine as opposed to the act of tasting it.

I saw a recommendation for "" Wine: A Tasting Course: Every Class in a Glass"", which seems to be a step in the right direction but also may be too similar?

The menu is still open but right now we just have the following dishes:

&amp;#x200B;

Dish 1: Clams and other seafood in a white wine sauce

Pairing 1: I was thinking a Muscadet ( [https://www.lcbo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lcbo/la-griffe-bernard-ch%C3%A9reau-muscadet-s%C3%A8vre-et-maine-2018-948182](https://www.lcbo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lcbo/la-griffe-bernard-ch%C3%A9reau-muscadet-s%C3%A8vre-et-maine-2018-948182) ) or Etna Bianco ( [https://www.lcbo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lcbo/tornatore-etna-bianco-2018-577676](https://www.lcbo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lcbo/tornatore-etna-bianco-2018-577676) ) but am open to other suggestions

&amp;#x200B;

Dish 2: Mushroom risotto

Pairing 2: I was thinking of a class pairing such as a Barbaresco, such as the one from Castello di Neive  ( [https://www.lcbo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lcbo/castello-di-neive-barbaresco-docg-160143](https://www.lcbo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lcbo/castello-di-neive-barbaresco-docg-160143) )

&amp;#x200B;

Dish 3: Prime rib or ribeye with rosemary cream mashed potatoes, lobster tail and B√©arnaise sauce, roasted Brussel sprouts

Pairing 3: Not sure here since we have both the lobster and red meat, I was thinking of getting a more expensive bottle (\~$60-$75) here such as a Brunello, Amarone, CdP, Bordeaux, Napa Cab, Chilean Carmenere, I'm pretty open to anything here, I just want something delicious and complex

&amp;#x200B;

Dish 4: Tira Misu

Pairing 4: I'm not sure if we will pair anything here, but keep the remaining amount of the budget to get a Cremant for our celebration

9,Road Reps: Repour/ZOS for your sample bottles?,"I'd like to get my samples budget a little more under control and get the most mileage out of the bottles I present before having to dispose of them.  As of right now, I pull corks, though if the account has a Coravin I'll use it.  For any open bottles, I'll roll around with them the next day (after testing in the AM for freshness and never presenting after the 30-hour mark); any Coravin-ed bottles I consider viable for one week, less if more than a quarter of the bottle was poured.

I have been looking at the Repour and ZOS Halo systems.  My primary concern with them is how travel will affect the wine: I am driving a lot every day, including elevation changes (from sea level and over mountain ranges) and winding backroads, not to mention the agitation the bottles face as the sample bag rolls along the sidewalk (sometimes over cobblestones too...).  Conceptually I am wondering how well they would keep sealed under these conditions, if the wine splashing up into the oxygen-absorbing material would compromise/negate it, and what a buyer would think when I present a bottle thusly sealed to him/her.

Are there any road-warrior reps out there with experience using these and if yes, are they worthwhile?  Would it be better to bite the bullet and get a Coravin for selective use (I wouldn't use it for the value-end of the portfolio obviously), or stick to the current gameplan eschewing all preservation methods and open fresh bottles?",wine,1576695622,NickofSantaCruz,2,1,True,2019-12-18

11,Help for final decision for Wine Pairing with New Year Takeaway Menu,"Hi all,

I have already received some advice and am now finalising the decision for a wine pairing for  a takeaway menu for New Years and some accompanying pairings. We are celebrating with us two and would like to pick options from our cellar if possible.

The menu is as follows:

First Course: Tartar of Scottish Red Label Salmon - Belgium Caviar - Horseradish - Sour Cream - Pickled Vegetables - Watercress

Second Course: Bisque of crustaceans with lobster and North Sea Shrimp - 'profiterol' of tomato, rouille, and Reypenaer (Cheese)

Third Course: Scallops a la plancha - Black Pudding Sausage - Cream of Celeriac and Jerusalem Artichoke - Bacon - Bread Crust Croutons - Hazelnutbutter

Fourth Course: Venison from the grill - 'Millefeuille' of wild Mushrooms - Tart of 'forgotten' vegetables - Chicory - Sauce of scezhuan pepper

Fifth Course: Rice pudding - Pineapple - Mango - Saffron - Marshmallow of coconut

Coffee &amp; Chocolates

I was thinking, New Year and all, to open up our best champagne for the first two courses. Main idea here so far is a  Dom Perignon Millesime Brut Champagne Vintage 2009.

Then go for one of our best Reds for the third and fourth course. The Domaine G. Roumier Chambolle-Musigny	2005 was suggested - would it suit best for these two courses?

Finally, a dessert wine for the fifth course and to end with the coffee and chocolates. I'd like to go with the Verdelho Madeira 1966 D'Olivieras though am afraid it might totally overpower the fifth course.

What would you recommend if you'd change anything, choosing from my existing cellar? As can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYDZZoQcS-1dhEea846imRVtIlIfbBlXe7bUJSbtmlg/edit#gid=1722385669.",wine,1576615757,Kalenden,2,1,True,2019-12-17

17,Exploring wine for the occasional drinker,"Tl;dr: looking for options to preserve bottels once opened and, more importantly, ways to be exposed to different types of wine as an only occasional drinker.

Hello all, I am new to the world of wine and am keen to explore it further. I have the funds and the inclination; the only problem is that I really don't get the opportunity to imbibe that often. I work a job with long hours that doesn't really lend itself to weekday drinking and, for a number of different reasons (more than I want to get into here) I'm more of a ""drink a glass or two on the weekend"" guy than a ""drink a bottle over the weekend"" guy if that makes sense. Also, I'm the only member of my household that drinks. As a practical matter, this means that my rate of consumption is about a bottle per month. I know, I know, at that rate, I've got a long ways to go, but hopefully I've got a lifetime to do it in!

The biggest challenge I face is how to finish a bottle before it goes bad. I'm happy to pay $30-$70 or more for a bottle of good wine, but not if I only get to enjoy one glass before it turns to vinegar. I've given boxed (and canned!) wines a shot and, while they keep well and some of them are okay to good, none of them are great and, as has been pointed out here before, options are limited to only a few vineyards and most are mixed wines. The only other option I've seen is a fairly expensive contraption that inserts a needle into the cork which, if that's all there is, I guess I'll invest in, but before I do that I thought I'd reach out to all you experts out there.

The other thing I've tried is ordering by the glass at wineries, restaurants, etc., but that's problematic because: 1) it's expensive; and 2) wineries and restaurants can be (understandably)  hesitant to open perfectly good/excellent bottles for a guy who's only buying one or two glasses and risk losing the rest if no one orders that particular wine in 24 to 48 hours.

However most of the information about Brunello is that it's dark and tannic (hence the need to age it for a few decades).

Nose: Intense soil, crushed strawberries, oak, ginseng root 

Taste: M/M+ body. High Tannins, Dry, Med+ Acidity. Taste follows the nose with a lot of minerality that adds body. The wine is pretty dry with gripping tannins that flies off the back. I get a brief note of mushroom in the middle with hints of soy sauce. This is all what I love about Saint - Emilion. Impressive for this wine at $13.

The first is a Bean Feta Fennel Casserole

The second is Minced Meat (probably beef) with Cabbage Pie

The final one is Tuna (canned) with  Zoodles  and Italian spices.

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

My own ideas (based on whats in my cellar and should be drunk soon) were:
For the first, either a Terra D'Oro Viognier or a 2011 Argiolas Vermentino di Sardegna Is Argiolas.
For the second, a Cabernet Sauvignon, perhaps 2011 Aquinas Cabernet Sauvignon
Final one, also either the Terra D'Oro Viognier or a 2011 Argiolas Vermentino di Sardegna Is Argiolas.

But if I fork out $200 for something that doesn't make a difference between the vacuum stopper or a simple cork then I'd be annoyed.

The reason I am looking for something is that during the week we like to have a small glass , not half a bottle each. At present , we will finish most bottles we open the same night to not waste it.

I reached out to the wine bar for information, but I'm not expecting it to lead to the end of my rainbow.

I'm almost certain that it was a Sangiovese, but it might have been a Primativo.  

I'm fairly certain that it was from Italy.  I believe it was from the Tuscany region.

I am 100% sure of the label - it was a creamy white label with red text.  Specifically, it had a large red 5 on the front of the label.

9,Questions about Wine Breath,"Posted this on r/alcohol and figured I should bring it up with the experts

GF enjoys a glass or 2 of rose' on most nights. After drinking, her breath is very hard to withstand even from 2-3 feet away. Exhales via the mouth are a particularly bad rose'/morning breath hybrid.

I've told her this, and she's taken some extra precautions like chewing gum and brushing vigorously. This helps, but ultimately it is still there. I've read that alcohol breath comes from the lungs/stomach on not the mouth, so it makes sense that brushing and gum is only mildly effective.

When we go to bed I can smell rose' breath even if we are facing separate directions! Basically, if she drinks rose' (and reds too), I'll smell it on her for the whole day. Also, if it's important, i don't smell anything when she drinks beer. The issue seems to be specific to wine.

So I'm asking a few questions:

1. Is this normal? Do frequent wine drinkers often have bad breath for a long time after drinking?

2. Any remedies? 

3. Am i overreacting? I personally don't care that much that she smells, but she is in a career where going out and having a glass is normal and I'm worried this could affect her professional relationships.

4. Is there a better sub for this post?

Thanks in advanced!

0,Help tweaking my recipes to force a wine pairing,"I have a bottle of Ponzi Reserve Wilamette Valley Pinot Noir. I really like this wine (though I‚Äôm not a fan of the ‚Äúregular‚Äù Ponzi), and for me it‚Äôs a relatively pricey bottle, so I‚Äôm trying to force it into my Christmas Eve dinner.  I want to tweak my recipes to pair with this wine as best as possible. 

The wife has voted for turkey... so I‚Äôm thinking of adding a dried thyme to a dry brine to complement herbal/woodsy flavors. 

I‚Äôm thinking of adding dried porcini to the gravy to help complement the mushroom element of the wine. 

The stuffing is standard sausage and sage and I think I‚Äôm good here. 

I was also going to roast some Brussels sprouts with smoked bacon and a drizzle of high quality balsamic.  Vegetal and smokiness being complimentary, and the sweetness of the balsamic being contrasting to the acid. 

I feel like I need another starch, maybe carrots?  I make some pretty badass glazed sous vide carrots.  Perhaps maple-pecan-parsley? Seems like this would contrast with the wines acidity OK.

6,Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for three dishes: Beef/Veal Stew (Wasabi Cocoa) with Carrot Fries || Cheesy Celeriac Pumpkin Lasagne || Egg Cauliflower Tomato Curry,"
For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals picked by my companion.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Beef/Veal Stew (Wasabi Cocoa) with Carrot Fries. Recipes are: http://inglouriousbananas.blogspot.com/2017/09/wasabi-chocolate-beef-stew.html and http://www.dinner-mom.com/carrot-fries-and-yogurt-dill-sauce/.

The second is a Cheese Celeriac Pumpkin Lasagne. Recipe (in Dutch): https://www.voedzaamensnel.nl/hoofdgerecht/lasagne-van-knolselderij-en-pompoen/

The final one is an Egg Cauliflower Tomato Curry. Recipe: http://www.cookingupclean.com/cauliflower-and-quail-egg-curry/

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

My own ideas (based on whats in my cellar and should be drunk soon) were:

First dish, a 2010 Ch√¢teau La Coste Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence Les Pentes Douces or 2010 Vi√±a William F√®vre Carm√©n√®re La Misi√≥n Reserva 
Second dish, a 2010 Schola Sarmenti Armentino Negroamaro - Primitivo  or   2008 Societ√† Agricola Nativ Taurasi 
Third dish, a 2013 Domaine de la Jasse Vin de Pays d'Oc Barrique Blanc perhaps? Or even a Repoured Viognier?

8,Aged Wines - How To Determine What's Worth It?,"I'm the current high bidder on a set of 6 aged napa cabs (1985-1998) + 2 napa pinots (1986 &amp; 1995) from a local auction house. Vast majority are into the neck or better int terms of fill. All have original cases as well. I feel pretty good about the storage, they have wine auctions regularly. I don't have high hopes for the pinots, but the cabs I think have a good chance of being in good shape. I've never won wine before since I usually bid pretty conservatively (IMO). But this is an online only auction and it closes in less than an hour, so I might have a chance this time. We haven't been able to explore aged wine much because of a lack of access. The only time we've had a cab of similar age was once at the Augustine Wine Bar in LA. And there are at least a couple of birth wines in there for both my husband and I. So for the experience alone, it seems worth it. But now I'm second guessing myself. My current bid is $320.  Thoughts? Is that a decently fair price?",wine,1575565949,swmccoy,15,1,True,2019-12-05

1,**Monthly Wine Challenge - December 2019 Selection and Discussion Post!**,"Evening everyone! Sorry for the lateness, but my body is still recovering from my night shifts last week.  I hope our American friends has a great Thanksgiving.  It looks like winter is in full swing around here, and Christmas is just around the corner.  With the busy season upon us again, remember to take some time out, relax, and enjoy spending time with your family and friends. So with that in mind, our selection this month is:

**Country: Any**

**Variety/varietal: Any celebratory wine/wine worth sharing**

Since this time of year is all about spending time with family and friends, what better way to celebrate the season with a glass (or two, or three, I dont judge) of holiday cheer.  So the challenge this month, my fellow wine lovers, is to post a wine that you open as a toast, something to drink around the holiday table, or perhaps you have a bottle of something special you want to open.  FIrst growth Bordeaux?  Perhaps a bottle of Champagne?  Or even that bottle of Caymus sitting in your cellar.  This is the month to open it!

So, just like with past MWC entries, us on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.).

If you are new to wine tasting, [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/2015/08/25/how-to-taste-wine/) has a great article to get you going.  Have fun choosing your wine, and I will see you all on the 15th!

**Discussion Time**  
So, I think we need to discuss the future of the MWC.  We don't seem to have the same level of participation as we did under  [/u/pbrooks19](https://www.reddit.com/u/pbrooks19/), and lately some of the posts have been a little discouraging.  So I ask, do we continue in the new year?  Do we let it come to and end?  Do we take it in a new direction?  If we do continue, please feel free to give suggestions as to grape and regions.

Dont judge the notes too hard I tried to remember what I could haha. 

2002 Piper Heidsieck Rare

1983 Inglenook Napanook Vineyard Rsv Cask Cabernet -Still had lots of life left...one of the favorites of the year. I did not even want to drink this one just smell it all day. Amazing!  

1999 La Jota Howell Mountain Cabernet 

1997 Taylor Fladgate Vtg Port 

2007 Perata Vineyards Yountville Cabernet -growers since 1942 on State lane in Yountville  

1984 Alexander Valley Vineyards Cabernet - the most surprising bottle of the year. Fruit was starting to fade but still great structure

2015 DB4 by Bryant Family- Drank too young...needs another few years in the bottle. Still a great Napa red for under $150.  

1986 Christian Brothers Napa Valley Cabernet- Could not find much info on this bottle. Good chance a lot of the fruit was Mt Veeder. Still kicking...fruit was still there and had some great structure. 

1986 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet- This bottle was also in the running for wine of the year for me. I can see why these bottles can last for decades. 

2015 Ridge Monte Bello Cabernet- Its Monte Bello...enough said! This wine delivers year after year. My favorite young Cabernet I drank this year.   

2015 ZD RSV Cabernet Rutherford- I do not see a lot of ZD posted on here. One of Napa's great family wineries. This wine is one to put away a coupe years but is still ready to drink now. 

1973 Inglenook Napa Valley Petite Sirah - Before all the petite sirah was ripped out of Napa in favor of Cabernet....this was a cool bottle to try from an iconic producer. Still had a bit of fruit left but was pretty faded. 

1982 BV George de Latour Cabernet- Drank on Valentines day this year and did not disappoint. I was amazed at how well this drank. Dusty cherries and tobacco! 

1976 Rodney Strong Cabernet- This might have been to most unique wine I drank this year. I contacted the winery and they actually sent me a tech sheet. I was expecting this wine to be totally over the hill but it was still kicking a bit. The wines was produced from the River West vineyard I believe.   

 1991 Robert Mondavi Rsv Cabernet- The obligatory birth year wine. This wine was incredible! Little mintyness, tobacco, dark fruits, and leather. This could go another decade + easily. 

 1973 BV George de Latour  Cabernet 375ml-  Not the greatest vintage but still a great wine. Held up well in the 375ml. A little fruit left but definitely past its prime. 

1977 Inglenook Charbono- This might be my 2nd favorite of the wines I drank this year.  Its sad there is almost no Charbono left in Napa...this wine was everything you want in an aged Napa wine. This wine had a surprising amount of fruit and I think it could had aged even longer. Was definitely on the down slope tho. 

1992 Swanson Napa Valley Syrah- Over the hill 

1996 Frogs Leap Rutherford Cabernet 1.5L- This wine was great...getting past its drinking window tho. 

NV ZD Abacus 17th bottling (1992-2014)- Picture got cut off but this is always a favorite to drink when I can. If you like the depth and complexities of a aged Napa cabernet but also the fruit forward and intensity that a younger Napa wine gives you this wine is a cool experience.

My main issue with red wine is that I find some of it to be dry, dry in the sense that it makes your mouth dry and all of the saliva disappear, which isn't exactly the most pleasant experience, especially when swallowing the wine. What is this actually referred to in the wine community? As I've noted that some of the wine I've tasted definitely doesn't have this characteristic at all and is instead quite thick that leaves the mouth feeling wet and full of taste. Also, what are the best indicators for this and where would be the best that would produce this?

9,Help me build a wine gift bag for my future in-laws!,"Hi everyone,

If this is against community guidelines or a megathread I did not see, please point me in the right direction and ban this post to the shadow realm!

My soon to be in-laws have done and are doing a lot for us this year. I have gotten really close with them since the engagement and have done many generous things for me and my fiancee - so I wanted to really ramp up their gift this year. Typically, it is a box of chocolates from a local upscale chocolatier and a bottle of Louis Martini since that is my future FIL's favorite bottle. They own their own business and when they aren't working or traveling, they basically just go out to eat or cook at home and love wine. They aren't connoisseurs by any means, just love wine.

**Here are some items/accessories I was thinking they could use or upgrading to be included in their wine box/bag!**

* Nice bottle opener
* Decanter
* Wine carrier that also holds wine glasses ideally
   * They go to a lot of BYOB places and just bring bottle of wines in their hand -- this past weekend we went to a thai place and half the glasses smelled TERRIBLE and it kind of killed the wine drinking mood lol
* Nice wine glasses - they have wine glasses, but nothing ""special"" if there is such a thing -- Thought it would be nice to get them nice wine glasses that they can call their own
* Nice bottle of wine - this is honestly the least important, during their last trip down to the shore, they stopped at a coscto and bought literally over $2000 worth of wine bottles ranging from $40-$80 a pop -- still not opposed to getting a nice bottle to include in this gift set depending on how much other things run

**Their favorite types:** Cab Sav, Sauv. Blanc, my fiancee and I love rose - Quick note: i have brought bottles over that pair well with the kind of food we are eating and they tend to like when I do that instead of always just drinking cab sav or suav blanc just cause they like it. So they do like to experiment. 

**Cuisine they eat a lot:** Thai, Sushi, Indian (they are Indian), followed by pasta, pizza, seafood

Last two things you probably would want to know is my budget and my location (due to availability of wine). 

**My budget**: $200 to $300

**Location**: Central Pennsylvania - state controlled - I do live near a few state/premium stores, thus they do have nicer selections and more diverse options

We have ordered a takeaway menu for New Years and are now looking to pair some beverages alongside it.
We are celebrating with us two and would like to pick options from our cellar if possible.

The menu is as follows:

* First Course: Tartar of Scottish Red Label Salmon - Belgium Caviar - Horseradish - Sour Cream - Pickled Vegetables - Watercress
* Second Course: Bisque of crustaceans with lobster and North Sea Shrimp - 'profiterol' of tomato, rouille, and Reypenaer (Cheese)
* Third Course: Scallops a la plancha - Black Pudding Sausage - Cream of Celeriac and Jerusalem Artichoke - Bacon - Bread Crust Croutons - Hazelnutbutter
* Fourth Course: Venison from the grill - 'Millefeuille' of wild Mushrooms - Tart of 'forgotten' vegetables - Chicory - Sauce of scezhuan pepper
* Fifth Course:  Rice pudding - Pineapple - Mango - Saffron - Marshmallow of coconut
* Coffee &amp; Chocolates

I was thinking, New Year and all, to open up our best champagne for the first two courses.

Then go for one of our best Reds for the third and fourth course.

Finally, a dessert wine for the fifth course and with the coffee and chocolates.

What would you recommend, choosing from my existing cellar? As can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYDZZoQcS-1dhEea846imRVtIlIfbBlXe7bUJSbtmlg/edit#gid=1722385669

I drink everything I buy within a month or two, so I am not too terribly concerned with creating temperature conditions ideal for aging or long-term storage. If I feel like doing some aging, which I probably won't do until I have a niece or nephew to lay down a case of Port for, I have a damp, pitch black basement with a fairly consistent 60-degree temp to do that in.

If anybody reading this has one of these racks, or an IKEA wine rack in general, I have a couple questions beore I pull the trigger on one or two:

1 - Are these racks good quality? I've had some bad experiences with flat-pack, IKEA-style furniture, so I'm very wary of it. 

2 - Will a magnum fit in these racks? I buy magnums fairly regularly, and I'd like them to be in there with all of my standard bottles. The bottles they used to model it *look* like they might be magnum-sized, but I'd rather not risk it. If they don't, no biggie, I'll store them upright on a shelf.

I'm looking for this information so I can get a better grasp on what my starting costs might be and how much money I'll need to spend to find the wines I want to import.

9,Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for three dishes: Chicken Apple Pepper Stew/Stir Fry || Feta Yogurt Pumpkin Pizza || Lentil Mushroom Tomato Ragu,"
For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals picked by my companion.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components. I appreciate any help this community is willing to give for a wine novice such as myself!

The first is a Chicken Apple Pepper Stew/Stir Fry. It is a Dutch recipe (https://koken.vtm.be/recept/wok-met-kip-appel-en-gele-paprika)  but contains mustard, chicken, a yellow pepper and apple, stir fried in a cream-based sauce.

The second is a Feta Yogurt Pumpkin Pizza. Again Dutch  (https://healthywanderlust.nl/recepten/gezonde-pizza-geroosterde-pompoen/) but it is a pizza topped with feta cheese, some rucola, yogurt, carpers, zucchini and pumpkin.

The final one is a Lentil Mushroom Tomato Ragu. The original recipe available through the waybackmachine (https://web.archive.org/web/20161106112010/https://theaccommodatingchef.com/2015/10/03/mushroom-ragu/). It contains Portobello, tomato, lentils mainly.

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

My own ideas are difficult. I have a cellar where I have a couple of bottles I think should be drunk soon. Suggestions from these would be great, but any thoughts are appreciated! For instance, I als have a

Also, some bottles are just too hard to acquire regularly and better enjoyed less frequently.

My guess is that the crowd here is mostly US and spanish wine is just not so popular in the US (because its not so prestigious as france or italy)?

6,Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for two dishes: Lamb Fillet with Eggplant Tomato Tzatziki || Mushroom Cabbage Cauliflower Stuffed Pancakes,"For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for two different meals.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Lamb Fillet with Eggplant Tomato Tzatziki. Inspired by the following recipe but without the taco and adding lamb fillet. http://jackienewgent.com/2016/05/eggplant-gyros/

The second is a Mushroom Cabbage Cauliflower Stuffed Pancakes. Inspired by this Dutch recipe: https://www.keukenliefde.nl/gevulde-pannenkoek-met-boerenkool-en-champignons/

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

My own preliminary ideas were:

For the first, 2012 Rebel Wine Malbec The Show. A solid piece of meat with spiced food sounds like it would pair well with Malbec.
Alternatively, 2010 Vi√±a William F√®vre Carm√©n√®re La Misi√≥n Reserva  or a 2006 Ch√¢teau Lilian Ladouys Saint estephe. Unsure

For the second, Pinot Noir sounds like an obvious choice but I'm unsure. I'd like something different from the first wine and am lacking inspiration.

I have plenty of wines so looking forward to your suggestions.

5,Bright Cellars wine Club - Pass on this.,"Bright Cellars is a convenient wine club that sends you regular wines. It's a good solution for people who are casual about wine, do not care for varied flavors and do not want to purchase wine. 

Bright Cellars purchase their wines from Sonoma 980 and then they create their own brand labels and apply it to the wines they send in their club. Their promise is that you will try varied and small wine brands - this is an outright lie. 

If you like and appreciate wines and exotic flavors, this really isn't a good fit as the quality is more for people who are casual drinkers and want something mild. The club attracts people by claiming they will only pay $10-15 for a $25 bottle when in fact the wine is actually $6 bottles that do not retail anywhere bc the brands they are from do not exist. 

Overall, if this is a good wine club for you - that's great and not my business to disrupt. However,  they are completely deceptive in their brand approach. It just infuriates me - it is common business practice to white label products in all industries, but their marketing and language is incredibly misleading.

I did not gage the crowd effectively.

Long story short, the hits of the party were a couple bottles of muscato, a riesling and a cheap red wine that was literally made from Concord grapes.

I'm pretty damn sure I was the only one to drink the beaucastel and I drank the whole thing by nights end.

I don't fault anyone for enjoying those other wines, in fact I'm glad they had a good time. 

I'm Just kind of bummed that I was unable to share my passion for wines and hopefully introduce others to what good wines can be like.

I think next time, since sweet white wines were all the rage I'll have to introduce them to a sauternes. Maybe that'll get the curiosity going for some of them.",wine,1574188681,Strid3r21,27,1,True,2019-11-19

[wine list](https://imgur.com/a/f1RTTFr)


This is my wine collection of 68 bottles. I‚Äôm 21 and I‚Äôve been buying here and there for 2-3 years. 


Here are some thoughts.


I really like finding interesting bottles like the 2013 Canonica Paiagallo and 2010 Roagna Paj√® Vecchie Viti, or a good bargain like the 1998 Beaucaillou I got for 73$/66‚Ç¨. I don‚Äôt have money to go buy a case at a time, and I want to try a bunch of different great wines, so that why I have a lot of one-offs. A big part of the enjoyment of wine for me is learning about the producer and their production, history, philosophy and cultural background. But interesting wines are usually expensive...


There aren‚Äôt a lot of ‚Äúeveryday wines‚Äù or ready to drink wines, so I rarely grab one. 
I should try to put older bottles in my collection to have more variety. However, I‚Äôm focused on building a collection for future me, and not necessarily one for enjoying now. 


What do you think I‚Äôm missing to have a more well rounded wine list?

Is it too conservative and old world?

6,Bad Wine?,"I was at Olive Garden and had an *excellent* cabernet sauvignon - Robert Mondavi 2016. Bold, fruity, and in-your-face. However, I regretted leaving without a bottle for home, so later on that day I stopped by my town's Wegman's to see if they carried that particular variant, and to my surprise, it did! Also to my surprise, it tasted nothing like what I had at Olive Garden earlier that day; it was kind of gross, actually.

Is it a common happenstance for bad batches of wine to come out of a winery like this? Or were my tastes tricked in OG? Or are my tastes just bad? Would it be worth it to try to pick up another bottle? Because it's a shame to find a great wine but then have an odd-smelling/tasting version of that same wine.",wine,1574087572,robotwithhumanhair22,25,1,True,2019-11-18
7,"After a few days in London, I wanted to thank you guys for the recommendations!!","So my wife and I spent the past week in London, working a bit, so we couldn't find the time to try all recommendations. However, i'll start by thanking you all, it is always cool to have so much answers.

First thing I will say : Damn, I am jealous of the wines available in London! There is such a wide range of cool wines to have, and the fact that most of them have Sherry and Madeira by the glass is fucking cool! Now the prices are another thing...
I live in Burgundy (poor me), and I've gotten so bored with the lack of choice we have in here...

The first place we stopped by was **the remedy**, cool little wine bar, nice wine list. They have a small cellar so it changes very fast. 

Later that day, we went to **Quality wines**, it was packed, but we loved it! not too much selection, but very diverse and prices were very good. Food seemed cool, and the √©picerie had a lot of very good products for sale.

**10 cases** was cool, we didn't have time to sit down and have a glass, but we had a look at the selection, which we found nice.

**winemakers club** is a nice place. Odd, i love the venue, the guys seem nice. but the list is strange! like it is obviously a natty place, but then there are some crazy bottles like 1989 mouton or some shit. Well i guess there is no regulation on Nat, so we can say Mouton is natty. Btg selection is good.

Other places we went (not really all wine bars, but they do have good wine!).

**Cork and Bottle**, an underground wine bar, lots of seating space and big wine list, lots of wine, more of a traditional selection, of bigger names (Bouchard etc.).

**Som Saa**, Excellent Thai restaurant with awesome cocktails and wine list.

**The French House** Very very good bistrot, the food is great (I had calves brains for the first time) and the wine are cheap, i think the only place I've seen serving bottles around the 22¬£ mark. And they were not bad at all.

So again, thank you all. You were great. To be 100% honest, this was actually not just to go for drinks. We are settling down in Portugal at the moment, and will start making our wine next harvest.

3,Opinions and Best use of Repour Wine Saver? (self.wine),"Hi,

I am looking for opinions, reviews and guidelines for the Repour Wine Saver (https://www.repour.com/). Personally, I have had good success with it so far but haven't yet used it beyond simple bottles of red wine, so I was wondering about other people's experience.

Specifically,

(1) Can I use it for sparkling wines (E.g., Champagne?) 

(2) Should I use it for fortified or sweet wines. Such as Ice Wines, Madeiras, Sauternes, ...

(3) If I open up a bottle and pour the glasses, should I immediately re-insert the Repour?

(4) Can I use the Repour for different bottles? I.e, we drink a bottle half-way and repour it. A couple of months after, we finish the bottle and seal the Repour with plastic wrap. Can this Repour still be used, for instance, for a smaller bottle or for another bottle we'll finish in two times? I have read it removes about 2L of oxygen so intuitively this would make sense.

(5) After inserting the Repour, I have to store the bottle upright. Put it back in the cellar or put it in the fridge?

Recently he took me out to a celebratory dinner and he got a bottle of the 2011 Chateau Lafite Rothschild, which while admittedly it was likely the single most exquisite bottle of wine I've ever had, it was certainly the most expensive. When I mentioned that I had had only previously had a one or two bordeauxs ever, and they were sub $40, he balked at the idea of cheap bordeaux even being possible. So, to open his eyes to french wine that doesn't require opening a second mortgage to drink, I was planning on giving my father a few examples of still good, but much more affordable bordeauxs for Christmas. I was thinking to get at least one bottle from the Pauillac region, since that is where Rothchild is, but other than that I have no idea what I'm looking for.

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is MeatBalls in Curry Peanut Sauce. With this recipe: https://www.mysugarfreekitchen.com/thai-chicken-meatballs-with-peanut-sauce/ but we would not use chicken but a ground meat blend.

The second is a Mushroom Cheese Pumpkin Casserole. A Dutch recipe: https://healthinut.com/eiwitrijke-pompoen-ovenschotel-tijm-paddestoelen/. Mostly it has pumpkin, mushrooms, eggs, thyme and cheese.

The final one is a small piece of Truffled Brie (soft cheese) with Tomato Zucchini Stew and Pumpkin Flatbread. The recipes for these last two are: https://www.happyfoodstube.com/pumpkin-flatbread/ and http://www.steamingpot.com/zucchini-cherry-tomato-mustard/

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

My own ideas (based on whats in my cellar and should be drunk soon) were, but extremely open to suggestions!


With the Brie, Flatbread and Tomato Zucchini either a (Coravined/Repoured) 2010 Joel Gott Pinot Noir Central Coast or a 2010 Louis Latour Bourgogne Blanc 200√®me anniversaire or a 2013 Domaine de la Jasse Vin de Pays d'Oc Barrique Blanc

With the Meatballs in Curry Peanut Sauce, perhaps something a bit more bold. A 2012 Rebel Wine Cabernet Sauvignon The Show? Its a dish with spices, so to match.

With the Mushroom Cheese Pumpkin Casserole. Could go with the Pinot here as well, I'd guess. Unsure.

1,Barbera just feels like a better version of Chianti to me,"I'm not a somme or anything but I've drunk a ton of Italian wine in the last 3 years since getting into wine and over and over I question why Chianti is so dominant. In that ""lane"", Barbera is just so much better to me. This is probably a gross oversimplification - but the lane I'm talking about it is that category of wine that will work amazingly well with pizza, tends to be dry and dusty/NOT fruity, and tends to be an acid bomb (a plus in book). Not ultra complex, not ultra expensive - just an in your face delicious dollop of acidity that works really well with food.

So In that role, I greatly prefer Barbera. All the qualities that I enjoy in Chianti are brought out better by Barbera to me: Barbera feels rougher, way more ""rustic"", and the acidity hits harder. I admit I'm not sure what I mean by rustic but that is just the feeling I get. Chianti in contrast feels like a milktoast version of it: basically Chianti is the overproduced boy band with a punk ashetic trying to pretend they're rebelling while each having a personal makeup advisor while Barbera is living in a squat recording stuff on their tape player.

It makes me sad because I have access to maybe 15 total varieties of Barbera in my city. Meanwhile there's at least 100+ Chianti to try. I'm moving to NYC soon though... that should help I hope, Really wish Angliacano was more popular and more available as well.

However, I stumbled upon a small wine shop in Boston specializing in natural wines. I bought a Frank Cornelissen ""Contadino"" Etna Rosso wine, and it absolutely blew my mind. It tasted incredibly fresh / refreshing, somewhat fruity without being sweet or even remotely sugary, had a large complex flavor while still being very ""light"" to drink, slightly carbonated...

Can anyone help me try to identify what is unique about this wine that I should be asking for to find similar wines? It is mind-bogglingly different than pretty much every other type of wine I've tried in restaurants. I did some research on what natural wine is, and it seems interesting, but honestly I don't care much about that... I just want wine that tastes as good as this one did.

This must sound very weird, but I'm reading a game of thrones right now, so I'm wondering if theres anything almost harsh/full?, maybe with a nutty or woody flavour that goes with the rustic feel of the book. I feel like I'm describing a red wine, but maybe one of you can point me in the right direction of a type/region or things to ask someone working at the LCBO.

1,(Urgent) Sparkling tasting help,"I wanted to organize a wine tasting including 3 sparkling wines this evening, but the advisor doing the tasting cancelled last-minute.  
Now I want to do a small tasting myself with some of the people who were to attend the tasting and who are fond of sparkling. Whereas there is quite some info on organizing a wine tasting, there isn't that much info on sparkling tastings. 

Due to the urgency of the issue, Im asking the community's help immediately (Im gonna google stuff after I post this):

I want to serve 3-4 sparkling wines (I already have a Beaugrand champagne which I need to finish soon bc its already 2y old), but I have no clue which ones I have to serve next to it. Neither of us are experienced tasters (I have 1/2 year of experience), and we all prefer dry wines.   
Can anyone help me choosing the (types of) sparkling I should serve?

A year ago, my girlfriend and I started getting deep into wine. We tried out every resource we came across to help us make progress‚ÄîWine Folly, Le Nez du Vin, Vivino, etc.

Along the way, we ran into the shortcomings of these resources. And being a designer + developer couple, we built our own solutions into an app with:

\- Technical wine data instead of crowdsourced ratings and reviews

\- A wine journal + taste profile that visualizes the wine styles you like

\- Wine recommendations based on technical data

\- Tags on wines produced en masse by E &amp; J Gallo, Constellation, etc.

\- An interactive map of the world's wine regions with soil and climate conditions, producers, and wines.

[Here's a link to download the app.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/true-wine/id1481005735) Check it out and let me know what you think! It's still new, so definitely still looking for feedback and bug reports.

When I [posted the map](https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/ap7j5k/im_working_on_an_interactive_map_of_the_worlds/) a while back, your reaction really stoked me up.

That was in 2008. 

The bottle has been through 2 cross country moves. It spent most of the decade being stored on top of our fridge... several apartments didn‚Äôt have air conditioning. So pretty much the opposite of climate controlled storage. But the cork looks to be intact. We were planning to open it on our 5 year anniversary... and then our 10 year... and those years have blown by and here we are.

1,What are everyone's thoughts on putting ice in a glass of wine?,"For reference; I have what I'd call quite a base knowledge about wine but would like to know more considering how much of it I drink.

I've worked in what is meant to be a wine bar for a few months now, (I say ""meant to be"" as its really just marketed that way as we serve a slightly broader range of wine than most bars in the area - but you can find all manner of alcoholic drinks there) and quite a lot of my customers tend to ask for a cube or several cubes of ice in their wine, usually in whites but there have been a few occasions when customers have asked for a cube of ice in red wine. 

I first started drinking red wine regularly late last year but when I started drinking white wine I would always put ice in it, purely because my customers did, but now I rarely put any ice in my glass at all when drinking wine and tend to enjoy whites without ice.

I wanted to know if there is any real etiquette to this, if its actually considered right or wrong or just personal preference.

4,Identifying wine faults,"Hi all,

I recently had a very unlucky yet interesting night with wine, when I took a couple bottles to drink with friends and both turned out to be unpleasant.  Although I knew that both were certainly faulty, I wasn't sure what exactly was the problem.

Grand-Puy-Lacoste 2010:  the nose was kind of musty, as people say of corked bottles, but my wife and I also found it to be somewhat farty(?).  Definitely unpleasant.  After sitting in a decanter for 3 hours (I didn't want to give up, but that was futile) the unpleasant smell lightened but was still lingering.  This was nothing like the usual GPL.  I think this was corked, but can't be sure as I haven't had a confirmed corked bottle before.  I'm particularly confused about the farty smell, as I usually see people mention wet cardboard / wet dog etc.

Clos des Papes 2014:  very, very pungent.  very sour on the nose, almost vinegary.  Did not improve with air nor after 3 hours after opening.  What could be the cause of this?

I'd love to know what you think.  RIP wines...",wine,1573194198,radioduran,13,1,True,2019-11-08

7,"Wine ""cellar"" in basement - good enough for medium term aging?","So I'm currently renting a house in somewhat exurban north-central Indiana. Apparently the house was built by the builder for himself as a second home and then he sold it off to the current owners. 

There is a room in the finished basement which is really just an auxiliary storage closet, but I guess in order to jazz up the property to sell, the builder staged it as a ""wine cellar"", decorating it with fake craft-store grape leaves hanging from a piece of wooden lattice panel set on top of the shelving units.   


I already put in temporary wine bottle shelving and have had a combo hygrometer/thermometer in there for the past several months - it usually hovers around 65-69 F and humidity around 50%. It almost never goes above 70, especially because I closed the vents for the central heat to the basement to save money.  Today I measured it at 64F. 

Is that good enough to store/age wine for at least 5 years? If not, is there anything I could do or install that wouldn't involve major construction to help improve the conditions?  The room is accessed by a door but the door is not exactly sealed, a lot of air can get in under the door and a bit around the door jamb.

5,"Talking with John Conover- Proprietor of Plumpjack, Cade, and Odette Estates","I got the opportunity to work the market with John Conover yesterday, John is the proprietor of Plumpjack, Cade, and Odette Estates in Napa Valley. 

2017 Cade Sauvignon Blanc- A pretty interesting Cali Sauvignon Blanc, blended with Musque, Viognier and Semillon. Stainless steel and concrete egg. No Malo. This wine strikes this interesting balance between wanting to be almost a little Rhone-white-like while being a classic example of California SB. 

2017 Plumpjack Napa Valley Chardonnay- Mostly fruit from Carneros with a little bit of fruit from Helena in there as well. Stainless steel and french oak and again, no malo to preserve freshness. I wont lie, in and amongst all the reds from Plumpjack I feel this falls a bit short. Freshness is there from the Carneros fruit and Helena fruit rounds it out alongside the 30-40% french oak, but I felt this wine got a little lost in the tasting...

2016 Adaptation Cabernet by Odette Estate- Fun little wine here. This is the second wine for Odette with purchased fruit from their growing partners. Most fruit comes from the backside of Howell with the remainder coming from vineyards throughout Napa. For the price point this is a great value in my opinion. You definitely get the blue and black mountain fruit vibe alongside a touch of dried herbs and tobacco. A very nice wine. 

2016 Cade Howell Mountain Estate Cabernet- My wine of the day. Cab, Mer, Malbec, Verdot. I have said to my coworker repeatedly recently that 'I just don't think I'm all that in to Napa Cab'... 

This guy changes that. It is big and plush, but it has a charming subtlety that makes you realize that not all Napa Cabs are made in the cookie cutter mentality. Dark Cherry, blueberry, cassis, clove and other baking spice and a kind of cocao nib richness, wrapped up in a firm acid and lithe tannin blanket. Love love love this wine.

2016 Plumpjack Cab &amp; Syrah-

Ok I'm getting to the point that I have to get to work but LOVE these two wines as well. The Syrah is always a favorite of the Plumpjack wines. We had the chance to taste the 15 and 16 side by side, and where the 15 is much more fruit and spice bomb and a little more in your face, the 16 has a refinement that makes it almost feel like its a cooler climate Syrah than what it is.

3,Found 42 bottles I inherited and forgot about....a little help?,"  

Upon cleaning out the basement several days ago, we found a large wine rack which had been obscured by all manner of inherited stuff from over the years. Some of the wines were leaking from the cork, all were covered in a good layer of dust. These bottles were gifted to us by my mother in 2010 when she and my father moved away. She worked at a winery and an annual wine competition in SoCal for a number of years. She took most of her collection with her, but left us some bottles. Look like dates between 1995-2010. 

Confession; am a Scotch guy, I don‚Äôt know the first thing about wine. My SO only drinks red so she would get a bottle every now and then for when we had company but over the years, with the inevitable accumulation of ‚Äòstuff‚Äô getting to the back of the basement had become difficult and eventually we stopped pulling bottles and then forgot they were there until now.

I have no idea what I have here or what to look for in terms of ‚Äúoh no man, don‚Äôt drink THAT‚Äù or ""should be ok if it tastes good"". Are any of these bottles noteworthy or known to not hold over time?

Below is the album of wines, 42 in all in 7 pictures.

[Album of Wine Groups](https://imgur.com/a/Tu2rXhl)

I read some of the post here and from what I gather the only way to tell if it is still good is to try it, preferably with a meal and backup bottle in case it turns out to be bad. I take it sampling a bad wine can't be too hard on the human body, am I wrong?

I also learned from reading around here that storage plays a huge role. Unfortunately, while the basement is the coolest part of the house, the summers the last 20 years in SoCal have been nowhere near optimal for the storage of wine, so I think I am looking at a lottery really. It can easily get above 85 down there over the summer and down to 40 at night in winter. The bottles that were leaking or had cork rot we threw out, about 10 bottles. 

What [about bottles that look like this in particular](https://imgur.com/a/EC0JKBz) because it has a very large amount of sediment buildup and you can see the clear part of the glass where the air bubble inside had settled while it was on its side, several of them are like this. Drinkable? Filter it?

While on the subject of drinkability, what [about bottles like this one where the cork](https://imgur.com/a/Vs6P5WE) has been halfway soaked?

Now though I have a bit more time to think about what I want to drink with it. 

To be honest I greatly prefer dry, non-fruity reds (so far - I may just not have tried the right white) but my actual experience with food and cheese in particular is that fruity white wines in general, borderline sweet or full on sweet in some cases pair more easily with cheese. Cheese seems to mute dry reds too much.

We don't normally drink Champagne or sparkling wine, so in preparation, I tricked her into trying Veuve Clicquot and Moet &amp;Chandon. She definitely preferred the lightly sweet aspect of Moet to the dry Clicquot. The Moet didn't really seem to blow her away though. Our only other experience is with Martin Asti which we both like, but I think it's much too sweet for the hike. 

For reference, when we drink white, the only one I've found that she likes is Kung Fu Girl. She generally drinks very bold reds. 

I am planning on buying one nice Champagne/sparkling wine for after dinner, then one Champagne/sparkling wine for after I pop the question on the hike.

6,2006 Comm. G.B. Burlotto Barolo Monvigliero.,"2006 Comm. G.B. Burlotto Barolo Monvigliero. Firm classic style, a fabulous effort from Burlotto. Still young, but a truly great wine!

G.B. Burlotto in Verduno has a storied past. The estate was founded in the late 19th century by Commendatore Giovanni Battista Burlotto who made the wine himself until his death in 1927. The Commendatore‚Äôs wines were highly esteemed in the early 20th century and they rivaled French Bordeaux for space in well-stocked European cellars. After his death the estate lapsed and Burlotto wines lost prestige. Today, however, G.B. Burlotto wines are once again highly acclaimed thanks to the work of Fabio Alessandria, the founder‚Äôs great-great-grandson. The 37-acres of vineyards are planted to Nebbiolo, Barbera, Dolcetto, Cabernet Sauvignon and Freisa, a red grape native to Piedmont. The Monvigliero Vineyard produces some of Burlotto‚Äôs most sought-after Barolos. These Barolos have cult status in Italy and Europe. The estate also makes Langhe Nebbiolo, Barbera, Dolcetto, Freisa and Pelaverga, a unique red wine made from the native Pelaverga grape.
Barolo is one of Italy‚Äôs greatest wine appellations. In fact many cognoscenti of Italian wines consider Barolo to be the apex of Italian winemaking. Barolo is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúthe king of wines, and the wine of kings‚Äù partly because until the mid-19th century Piedmont was owned by the noble House of Savoy, the historic rulers of northwestern Italy. And the Savoys had a taste for Nebbiolo. Nestled into the rolling hills of Langhe, the Barolo DOCG includes 11 communes, one of which is the town of Barolo. There are 4,200 vineyard acres in the appellation and since the late 19th century growers have tried to identify their best vineyards. By marketing some vineyards as better quality than others, Barolo producers have followed the Burgundian custom of making single vineyard, or ‚Äúcru‚Äù vineyard bottlings. As in neighboring Barbaresco, the Barolo DOCG requires that wines be 100% Nebbiolo, a grape thought of as the Pinot Noir of Italy. Records show that Nebbiolo was grown in the Piedmont as early as the 14th century, and despite being somewhat finicky ‚Äî it is late to ripen and easily damaged by adverse weather ‚Äî ‚Äî Nebbiolo makes highly aromatic and powerful red wines. Until the mid-19th century Nebbiolos of Piedmont were vinified as sweet wines, though that ended in the late 19th century when a French oenologist was invited to Piedmont to show producers how to make dry reds. Barolo was made a DOC in 1966 and upgraded to DOCG status in 1980. Barolos must be aged at least three years, at least two of those years in wood. Barolos are tannic and robust and generally need at least five years to soften into complex, earthy wines.

2,"Trip report: Paso Robles around harvest season (hidden gems, a couple duds)","My wife and I recently got back from a weekend trip to Paso Robles.  I got some great recommendations from /r/wine and thought I‚Äôd give back a little with a trip report.  My palate skews towards big Napa cabs but I‚Äôve been hoping to expand that some and this trip was a great time to do it.
 
With that introduction, we visited 8 wineries in 2 days:
 
Day 1:
 
* L‚ÄôAventure:  classic Paso Robles.  Tasting was booked in advance and was done standing at the bar. The wines were, unsurprisingly, delicious but entirely young. These are not bottles you will want to pop for at least a few years. The Optimus was a screaming value.  My wife and I had differing views on some of the others (her palate tends to enjoy higher acidity wines than mine). 
 
* Booker:  right next door to L‚ÄôAventure, we arrived without a reservation but they were able to accommodate us on the patio. Their rose (aptly named Pink) is just funky and weird and altogether awesome. It‚Äôs strawberry neon.  The balance of the reds varied from okay to good.  White (their‚Ä¶ white wine) was the biggest dud of the weekend.  Maybe we got a bad bottle.  It was really aggressively not good.  The surprise here was My Favorite Neighbor (named after Stefan, L‚ÄôAventure‚Äôs winemaker), Booker‚Äôs ‚Äúsecond label.‚Äù  Both of their reds ‚Äì MFN and Harvey and Harriet ‚Äì knocked our socks off.  H&amp;H especially came in as one of the true value pours of the weekend.  We joined the MFN club.
 
* Tablas Creek:  came here based on Reddit recommendations and the need for a spot to picnic.  By far the most commercial operation of the weekend.  The wines were okay.  They‚Äôre doing some interesting blends and the whites were among the better ones we tasted.  The reds were largely forgettable.  Staff here were hit-or-miss; some were incredibly pleasant but we had a few surly folks who didn‚Äôt do wonders for the brand.  I wouldn‚Äôt come back but am glad we visited.
 
* Jada: another Reddit recommendation.  Tasting room has beautiful views of the vineyards and the staff were very nice.  The wines, though, were nearly uniformly awesome.  Really great Paso-style blends that played with varying intensities and styles.  I also appreciated that their wines had a good mix of easy-to-drink young bottles and some that would benefit from cellaring.  Prices were in line with quality.  Signed up for the club.
 
Day two:
 
* Niner:  we were already members and signed up for a morning harvest tour.  I think Niner is one of the best values in California wine.  They are putting out a full portfolio of delicious, interesting (albeit not necessarily thought-provoking) wines at stupidly affordable prices.  The tasting room is gorgeous.  The vineyards are gorgeous.  The staff is great.  And the winery is committed to sustainability.  Worth a stop for anyone in the area.
 
* Clos Solene: recommended by a friend.  This is high quality, low production wine at its finest.  The wines are uniformly restrained without being underpowered.  Each told a different story and you could really see the winemaker‚Äôs viewpoint carried through each bottle. It is a small tasting room.  We joined the club.
 
* ONX: to close out the day we made our way over to Tin City. Someone had recommended ONX as a must-see.  We were disappointed.  This was the least impressive set of pours of the entire weekend and I would recommend strongly that you skip and go to any of the other options in the area. Despite having virtually no one in the tasting room, pours were slow.  And what was poured was‚Ä¶ weird. Weird in a bad way.
 
* Benom: hidden gem of the trip.  Started by brothers Arnaud and Guillaume Fabre (the latter is the winemaker at Clos Solene), Benom is focused on premium Napa-style reds made in Paso.  Ultra low production.  Screaming value.  We were getting pours via Coravin of 2017 wines that were drinking gorgeously yet showed easy potential for aging (especially Origin and the soon-to-be-released Muze).  Seriously you need to stop here.  They are going to be rocketing to success in the next few years.  Joined the club.  Easiest decision of the trip.

I'm struggling with the ""contains sulfites"" label. In the USA by law the label is needed if the wine comes with more than 10 ppm, and I guess up to 200-400 ppm depending if it's white, red, sweet wine. My point is that between 10 ppm and 200 there's a huge difference but there's no way to understand this just from this pointless ""contains sulfites"" label because at the end almost all wines comes with 10+ ppm. 

So does a database exist to tell me how much ppm are in each wine bottle? When I buy a bottle I'd like to find out the sulfites quantity, or at least to know a range... again no big deal between 30 and 31 ppm, but it is a big deal btw 20-30 and 190.

7,Wine fridge frustration,"Hey all,

I know this topic is beat to death and not nearly as enjoyable as 'look what i'm drinking' but I could really use some help.

I've been looking on Amazon for a wine fridge in the 100-160 bottle range (I have about 90 bottles currently). Also, in the sub $1300 range. I have found some OK options but I really feel like they all kinda suck. None have great reviews... the ones that do have about 2 reviews that look fake.

Should I just get whichever one ticks the most boxes and add on the 4-year warranty and call it good?

4,1997/1998 Napa Cabernet,"Over this weekend I drank four pairs of these wines.  Each pair was drunk side by side but it was not a blind tasting.  All the wines had been cellared since release.  Because of the situation the wines were drunk at dinners I do not have extensive notes.  The pairs were Insignia, Montelena, Staglin, Viader.  While the wines were different there was a definite vintage characteristic.  The 1997s were bigger and more complex.  The 1998s were more pure fruit and focused.  Both are drinking well and while capable of lasting for some time are clearly in a great drinking window.  My notes:

&amp;#x200B;

Viader 

1997 dark cherry dark licorice nose dark cherry chocolate tobacco big dry tannin long finish ready but will last

1998 pure cherry nose sweet cherry red fruit big tannin touch of tobacco

&amp;#x200B;

Insignia

1997 dark fruit dark licorice chocolate tobacco

1998 sweet dark fruit smooth tannins touch of tobacco

Staglin

1997 sweet dark and blue fruit smooth tannins

1998 sweet dark fruit 

Both are beautiful sweet fruit medium tannins

&amp;#x200B;

Montelena 1997 Montelena 1998

Both are excellent and drinking perfectly

6,Is Vivino just plain junk?,"I started using this app after I read a few positive comments either here or some reading I was doing. I‚Äôm mainly interested in three different aspects of it: crowd-sourced tasting notes, keeping track of what I‚Äôve tasted, and scanning wines at a new store I might visit to compare the price on a bottle of wine with which I‚Äôm not familiar. 

But there is one aspect that just bugs the crap out of me: certain aspects of various wines of which I take pictures are mis-characterized or mis-identified. For example, I‚Äôve been tasting a lot of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape blanc and the app constantly mis-identifies it as red. Same with Cotes du Rh√¥ne white/red. It also has a bad habit of mid-identifying vintage years. 

Though I am working on redoing a space at home to make room for a wine fridge, I don‚Äôt consider myself a collector and probably won‚Äôt ever have enough wines to use something like CellarTraker.

I'm trying to secure a shot with E and J Gallo's Sales Development Program in the summer of 2020 (graduating with bachelors May of the same year!).   


I've already applied so I can't do as much to spruce up my resume, but I was wondering if I could get your advice on either making myself stand out during the interview or even experiences/skills that would help when applying to other wine related opportunities. This is an industry I am passionate about working in and want to do all I can to secure my shot. I know it's as high paying as other fields, but my passion and extremely low student debt really cushion that for me :).   


About me:

* Economics major, stats minor with business administration certificate (can change to business minor and still graduate on time)
* Wine knowledge (not a master sommelier, but can know my way around a Merlot)
* Politcal canvassing and sales experience
* Social media management experience
* Worked with hometown chamber of commerce and community college business club as student marketing officer
* Joining school marketing club (recent transfer) and soon to be made sales club  


I'd pretty much be interested in hearing of any advice you folks have on bulking up my chances and what has worked in your experience (if you work in the industry). I've researched the company like its my job and have tried some of their products. I'm currently on a part-time job hunt and have been looking at both open sales jobs and liquor store positions. I also live in Colorado where the craft brewing industry is pretty massive so I've kept an eye out for any opportunities there.

1,Wine Preservation Question,"Hello all, as a college student and new wine purchaser/consumer, I‚Äôve been trying methods to extend the life of my cheap wines 1-2 weeks since I only have a glass every few nights. I‚Äôve read that basically wine turns bad due to contact with oxygen, a process that slowly begins after opening.

My question, albeit possibly chemistry heavy, is if it is possible to slow this process by introducing CO2 (blowing into bottle) or a different gas in the bottle immediately after pouring and before resealing the bottle with cork/stopper to minimize contact with O2? Would this reduce souring? Also, is there any concern of wine ‚Äúpulling‚Äù different chemicals from the ambient gas and making it even worse?

Might be a dumb question, but I‚Äôd appreciate any insight or cheap pro tips for making some $5 bottles last a little longer. Thanks!",wine,1570511498,MrJawelsh,12,5,True,2019-10-08

5,Austrian Wines - A brief rundown,"Getting Caught Up

Austria is increasingly becoming one of Europe‚Äôs most important wine growing countries. With an annual production of around 35 million cases it out produces it‚Äôs friendly neighbor, Germany, by 30%. Though both countries produce primarily white wines, Austria is partial to fuller-bodied and drier wines and their warmer climate has lead to a much greater success with red wines than Germany. 

This central European country has been growing vines, possibly, for over 2000 years, though, the first recorded vineyards popped up with the Celts around 500 b.c. Viticulture continued to flourish under the Roman Empire and after a succession of scorched earth-raids and foreign domination, vines began to appear steadily and more frequently, becoming part of the natural landscape by 1300. The Austrian Monks planted vines on the Danube, west of Vienna, in an area now known for it‚Äôs fine dry whites, the Wachau. As the vine production grew, exponentially throughout the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, Austria was forced to outlaw the sale of imported wines across the southern territories. 

Austrian wine comes from both sides of the Danube, a major shipping and recreational river that cuts through the country from west to east. The climate, both drier and generally warmer than Germany, is perfect for their burgundian Chardonnays and Loire-esque Sauvignon Blancs. Wachau, Austria‚Äôs most prized region, is the furthest the Atlantic airstreams penetrate the Danube valley, and thus benefits rom its moderating effects. 

Austria currently boasts around 35,000 vineyards, two thirds of which are operated by part-time wine growers and sit on less than 2.5 hectares. All of the vineyards are in the eastern part of the country, and at least 60% comes from Lower Austria, which confusingly resides in the north east part of the country. Hmm. 

The Grapes 

Austria‚Äôs crown jewel is Gruner-Veltliner, a lightly fruity, dry and full-bodied white with occasional hints of spice, accounts for more than 30% of Austria‚Äôs total vineyard area. The second most important varietal is Welschriesling, literally meaning ‚ÄúRomanic Riesling.‚Äù This grape is grown predominately in Burgenland, to make either sweet wines of fantastic quality and many fine dry wines, notably in Styria. Muller-Thurgau, another of Austrias greatest hits, is quickly declining in oimportance, despite being Austria‚Äôs fourth most planted varietal. 

The indigenous Zweigelt, now the country‚Äôs third most planted grape, is found in all districts. Pinot Blanc and Chardonnay are also widely planted, as are Traminer, Gew√ºrztraminer and Pinot Gris rounding the 5th - 10th most planted grapes. New comer - Cabernet Sauvignon is slowly catching on in Burgenland, but Blauer Burgunder, known to most as Pinot Noir, is showing greater success in the warmer climate. 

The Regions

Weinviertel is Austria‚Äôs largest wine region. Flat, fertile and dry, this region typically produces interesting light, dry white wines from Gruner Veltliner to Muller-Thurgau. Riesling and Pinot blanc are also well represented in the region. 

Burgenland, which was part of Hungary until after World War 1, has four wine regions; Mittel Burgenalnd, known for its complex and bold Blaufrankish, and Sud Burgenland which produces some‚Ä¶ good reds and whites, though not as famously. Burgenland vines make up a third of all Austrian vino and most of its best Cru Reds and sweet, dessert wines. 

Donauland runs east along the Danube and is famous for its gritty and outstanding Gruners. Styria is a mountainous region with more similarities to Slovenia than the rest of Austria. It‚Äôs districts only produce around 5% of all wines in the country. 

Lastly, and most importantly The Wachau, considered by many to be Austria‚Äôs top region for dry whites. The main grape in this region is Riesling, followed by gruner. The vines grow predominantly along narrow terraces, which grip and climb steep hillsides up to two hundred meters up from the banks of the Danube. Irrigation and a prideful fanaticism have allowed this region to reach its potential in the last 20 years. Additionally, this region does not follow the usual German and Austrian Pradikt quality classification for its wines, but instead uses its own names for the three levels of ripeness. Steindeder wines are meant to be enjoyed earlier, while Federspiel benefit greatly from one two years bottle age. Smaragd wines are considered the best of the best and have an incredibly long age process, lasting sometimes for decades. 

The Classifications

Austrian labelling laws are some of the strictest in the world, out doing even Germany. Their nomenclature shares a lot of the German classifications, but standards in general and minimum weights in particular are higher. Though hotter summers mean it is much easier to achieve higher sugar levels than their neighbor.

Qualitastswein is a category in which wine must come from a single district, specified on the label and must demonstrate the characteristics of varietal from which it is made. The wine must have at least 9% abv. The wines also must not be chaptalized and sugars must not exceed .9%. 

Spatleses Pradikatswein must be from one district, vintage dated and have its weight authenticated and certified officially. Like Germany, no Prakiatswein may be chaptalized. No Spatslese may be sweetened by sugar reserves; all alcohol and R.S have to be the natural result of the grapes themselves. Spatlese must also be made from fully ripe grapes, picked at minimum must weights and levels. Auslese cannot contain any unripe or unhealthy grapes. Stohwein, or Straw wine, must be made from overripe grapes which have been dried on straw for at least three months. Eiswein, or Ice wine, should only be made from varietals with incredibly high sugar levels and then picked and pressed while still frozen and fermented. Beerenaulsese, is a very sweet wine made from botrytis grapes are picked under the same conditions as Ice wine, but are not, however, frozen. Lastly, Trockenbeerenauslese is a very very sweet wine made from fruit with a must weight higher than all of the preceding classifications, the grapes must be shriveled, overripe and ridden with botrytis. 

This concludes your lesson in Austrian viniculture, now on to more ‚Äòpressing‚Äô matters. (Get it? Pressing.. like grapes! Ahh, forget it.)",wine,1570465140,GoodPandas,2,1,True,2019-10-07

1,What wine do you love for its complexity?,"I‚Äôm a novice wine drinker. I love exploring and drinking different things, but my knowledge level is low and my ability to adequately describe what I like is lacking. No matter.

Like many of you I‚Äôm in a constant search for thought provoking food and drink experiences. About 15 years ago (back when the most expensive wine I drank was $10) my dad splurged on a bottle of Amarone at a restaurant. It was magical. I knew instantly that this was special. For the first time I understood how pleasurable a glass of wine could be. It was brilliant in its complexity. Every sip was savored in silence while staring intently at the glass. I still think about it all these years later.

Can I describe to you what it tasted like? Certainly not. Do I know any details about the bottle? Unfortunately no. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped me from searching for that same joy and wonder.

I‚Äôve recently found similar enjoyment from tradizionale balsamic vinegar. The kind that is regulated by the Italian government and can only be sold in a specific bottle.

So my question to you: what wine do you love for it‚Äôs complexity? What wine have you found to be particularly thought provoking? 

Maybe I‚Äôll splurge on a bottle. Or maybe it‚Äôs impossible to acquire and I‚Äôll just learn something. Either way, I‚Äôd love to hear about it.",wine,1570064775,byrans,9,5,True,2019-10-02

Regions that are currently on our radar:

- Bordeaux
- Cotes du Rhone
- Duoro valley
- Tuscany

Wine preferences: 

- Fiance leans more big, fruit bombs with plenty of tannins. I lean more medium-bodied, earthy, fresh. 
- We both prefer natural winemakers, smaller operations, and enjoy experimental wines.

1,**Monthly Wine Challenge - October 2019 Selection Post!**,"Hi Everyone,

Welcome to the October challenge selection post!  So, it looks like last months selection was a bit of a miss for most people, though I was a bit surprised.  Hopefully we can turn it around this month!  So with that said, its time to give thanks!  In Canada, we celebrate Thanksgiving this month, so I thought it might be nice to look at a grape that pairs well with turkey (or at least, so Ive heard anyway).    With that being said, it is back to a red wine this month. So, without any delay, our selection this month is:  


\*\*Country: France\*  
\*\*Variety/Varietal: Red Burgundy\*\*  


I'm not sure when or if we did Red Burgundy before, so i felt it was time to showcase it!  For those unaware, pinot noir is the grape of red burgundy (though technically Beaujolais is part of Burgundy, we will limit this months selection to pinot noir only).    


So, just like with past MWC entries, us on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.).

If you are new to wine tasting, [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/2015/08/25/how-to-taste-wine/) has a great article to get you going.  Have fun choosing your wine, and I will see you all on the 15th!",wine,1569976493,PhoenixRising20,14,13,True,2019-10-01

4,Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for three dishes: Halloumi Burgers with Portobello Bun and Spicy Mango Chutney || Chicken and Broccoli on Sweet Potato Pizza Crust || Bean Alfredo with Zucchini Pasta,"For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is a Halloumi Burgers with Portobello Bun and Spicy Mango Chutney (inspired by https://www.thelastfoodblog.com/halloumi-burgers/

The second is a Chicken and Broccoli on Sweet Potato Pizza Crust (see recipe https://ifoodreal.com/sweet-potato-pizza-crust/ , will use non ground chicken instead of turkey)

The final one is a Bean Alfredo with Zucchini Pasta (based on https://lemonsandbasil.com/white-bean-creamy-alfredo-with-zucchini-pasta/)

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome!

My own ideas (based on whats in my cellar and should be drunk soon) were quite difficult, my companion sure does not cook casually!

I have a 2007 Impernal Cahors Malbec (french Malbec) which I'd hoped might go with the strong Halloumi flavours. Otherwise, a 2012 Rebel Wine Malbec The Show? THough no experience with that type.
Rose might also pair: 2013 Chemin des Papes C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Ros√© ? Or a crisp white? 2013 Domaine de la Jasse Vin de Pays d'Oc Barrique Blanc? Perhaps Western Cape White Blend 2013?

For the Chicken and Broccoli, which has smoked flavours, perhaps a Napa Cellars Chardonnay 2011 might work? Or 2011 Jacob's Creek Chardonnay Reserve?

For this i would like to step into a better price range. I was thinking to spend 60-80 dollars. 

My constraints:

60-80 dollars. +/- 5 dollar wiggle room. If you say this 50 dollar bottle is the best over anything in my range thats fine or if its 85 i wont gripe. 

Red wine thats full bodied and bold as this is what we have usually enjoyed together. 

It can be either one bottle or two that add to the range if you feel so compelled or are passionate/split by any two choices.

I'd like to be able to have a small amount of knowledge to recommend a wine of the same taste when customers cannot find thier favourite stocked at our hotel. We are a small hotel tavern but we stock around 30 to 40 types. From prosecco to shiraz. I'm hoping this makes some sense. I just want to help my customers and quit looking hopeless when I'm asked anything about wine. Are there questions I should be asking? 

I do know bubbly is served in flutes, white in plain wine glasses and red in the bigger rounder ones, I don't even know what you would call them honestly. 

I can put an ice bucket together like nobody else, I can pour a red with no drip, hand at the base. I think I can serve them ok, any pointers are always welcome of course. It's the reccomendations I struggle with. If there's a website or book I should read up on maybe? But if love to hear straight from the people who love it the most, you guys.

0,"Going to an Australian wine tasting, could use some suggestions.","In a week I'm gonna attend Australian wine tasting for the company I work for but I like to do some preliminary work, so I don't have to go to every table and ask the same questions; my company's look for wines that are at least sustainable, great designs/labels and have no importer already (since I'm not in the US, you can just ignore that last one). That is partly the reason I'm attending, the other reason is just to learn something about Australian wine.

I barely know anyone on the list, except of course big players as Leeuwin Estate, Penfold's, others like Penley Estate, Wirra Wirram, Brash Higgins... and of course stuff like Yellow Tail, 19 crimes etc. that we'll just ignore.

Do you recognise some of the other producers, or; are there any of these you would recommend to check out, even if they don't fit in with my company's philosophy?

1,Difference between Vintage Port and Tawny,"I've just had some Tawny Ports that I enjoyed and after looking into it more, it's my (potentially incorrect) understanding that Tawny Port is barrel aged port that made to taste like Port that's [10/20/30] years old (and is ready to drink when bottled).  Does this mean that a 20-year old Vintage Port will have a similar flavor and structure profile as a 20-year Tawny Port, even thought it's produced/aged quite differently?

I'm just trying to wrap my head around this to figure out if I should buy some 40 year old Tawny Port and 40 year old Vintage Port.",wine,1569804645,IAmPandaRock,8,1,True,2019-09-29

4,Hey wine pros! Here's my best advice for selling wine in a tasting room.,"It's busy season right now, and I'm sure my fellow wine pros who work in tasting room/direct-to-consumer sales have sales goals and membership signup quotas they're trying to meet. 

I've sold a lot of wine in my career. Shit, I sold a lot of wine _today_. And, after a ton of trial and error, I found there's only one way to convince a guest to walk home with a case (or four):

# Don't focus on the wine. Focus on the guest.

So many wine pros make the mistake of trying to geek out about the wine, but if you're just repeating a well-rehearsed spiel you'll have a hard time selling.

Almost no one cares about wine the way you care about wine. I bet that a detailed tasting note has never gotten you laid.

Wine is incredibly personal. If you want to sell wine to a guest, it helps to know why they've decided to trek across the state/country/world to visit you at your winery. 

## Questions to ask your guests

Forge a genuine connection with your guests by asking them questions and getting to know them. 

Here's a list of questions to use as a jumping off point:

- Where are you visiting from?
- How has your vacation been going so far?
- What other wineries have you visited?
- What other wineries are you planning to visit?
- Where are you staying?
- What does the rest of your day look like?
- Are you doing anything else while you're in _insert geographical location_, or are you just visiting wine country?
- Have you visited _insert geographical location_ before?
- What's for dinner tonight?
- Where have you eaten during your trip?
- What kind of wine do you usually drink at home?
- Have you visited _insert winery_ before?
- Why did you decide to visit _insert geographical location_?

Remember to listen more than you talk. 

## Good topics of conversation

Finding a (non wine-related) topic of conversation can help you connect with your guests and sell more wine. Here are topics that tend to work for me:

- Hiking
- Cooking/food
- Dogs/cats/other pets
- Skiing
- Travel (especially international travel)
- Movies
- Music (especially festivals and live acts)
- Art
- Video games
- The Golden State Warriors
- Star Wars
- Cannabis

People love to give advice, so when I find out that a guest has an obsessive passion I ask them to give me their best advice for n00bs. I've learned a lot of interesting shit this way.

## Recommend other wineries

Since I live in wine country and I use the fuck out of the comped industry tasting perk, I have a lot of favorite local wineries.

When a guest tells me they love Zinfandel, I make sure to recommend Chase Cellars, Joseph Swan, and Robert Biale. When they ask about Merlot, I tell them they have to check out Robert Sinskey, Pride Mountain, and Frog's Leap. 

This is legit helpful to your guests: you know more about wine than they do, and they're visiting your winery because they want to learn more about wine. 

If they've got a gap in their schedule and you know of a winery you think they would like, offer to make a call to try and get an appointment for them. Admittedly, this works better once we get out of busy season.

## Closing the sale

I like to ask for the sale, but my sales are worse when I do this by saying ""is there anything I can send home with you today?"" 

I've found the best way to approach asking for the sale is as follows:

1. I give them their final pour, and tell them they should make themselves completely at home. I want them to relax and enjoy.
2. I tell them that they have an order form on the table. 
3. I say something along the lines of ""Mark any wines you'd like to take home or ship on the order form. I'm happy to answer any questions about shipping when I come back to check on you.""
4. I offer more water and tell them I'm happy to get them any revisits if they'd like.
5. I leave.

Look, I know that not everyone is going to buy wine from me, but I treat every person like they've already bought a case of wine. Buyers want the buying process to be clear, so I make it as clear as possible. This is the point where I'm all business ‚Äì but since I've already formed a relationship with the guest, it doesn't come across as salesy.

## Your company provides you with business cards for a reason.

And it's not just so you can get comp tastings at other wineries.

When a guest drops a bunch of money on a large wine order, bring them your card when you bring them their receipt. Tell them that you'd be happy to answer any questions they might have about upcoming vintages, and that they're welcome to email you if they need to stock up. Offer to help them with recommendations for their next trip to _insert geographical location_.

Sometimes, I write my (professional, wine-related) Instagram handle on my business card in pen. It helps my guests get in contact with me even if I switch jobs (not that I'm planning to, since I've currently got my dream gig). But, more importantly, it's a great way to network.

## TLDR

- Instead of geeking out about wine, get to know the guest
- Ask them questions, and find areas of mutual interest
- Provide excellent customer service by recommending other wineries and making purchases easy
- Drop your business card and treat the sale like a networking opportunity 

Good luck out there, fellow nerds. If any of you are currently working as tasting room staff in the Napa Valley, feel free to send me a message if you want to connect professionally. And AMA if you have any questions about tasting room sales, I'm happy to answer them.",wine,1569820482,caseyjosephine,19,7,True,2019-09-30

5,Food/spice that caused wine to taste like perfume,"What food or spice could change your taste buds to cause red wine to taste like perfume?   Here is what happened.

I had a bottle of Pinot Noir opened on Thursday and it tasted fine.  I had a small glass on Friday afternoon of the same Pinot and it tasted fine.  I went out to eat Fri night and ordered a glass of Cabernet sauvignon and it tasted fine.  

Then I ate shrimp cocktail that had a fresh cocktail sauce fairly heavy with horseradish and interestingly lots of diced celery.  I also got minestrone soup and a pasta dish with a rich bolognese sauce.  After eating the shrimp cocktail and some of the pasta I took a sip of the wine and it tasted like perfume had gotten in it.  I tried my wife's red table wine and it tasted perfumey.  None tasted like perfume to my wife.  I got home and tried the Pinot Noir again for comparison and it now tasted perfumey.   

Now, on Saturday, I try the Pinot Noir again (same bottle now three days old) and it tastes fine.  So, something in the food most likely either the horseradish, celery or fresh basil that was in with the shrimp cocktail and some in the minestrone soup shifted my taste buds and caused them to pick up this perfume taste in the mid-palate.   And, this was not subtle at all.  I wouldn't get it in the front or back palate but in the mid and it would last a good 10 seconds and was pretty intense. 

I've been pairing wine with food to discover wonderful blendings of flavors for over 30 years enjoying somewhere over a thousand to two thousand meals playing with the interplay of wine and food.   And, in all that time, nothing like this has ever occurred before.  

I think I have ruled out any contamination of glasses or the wine with three different wines, different glasses and the fact that one wine was a constant over the three days.  And, nothing else tasted of perfume except the wine.  The food all tasted fine.  I smelled everything carefully and could not pick up perfume in any of the food.   Quite a mystery.  I have heard that somewhere around 20% of all people perceive cilantro as soapy and thankfully I am not part of that population.  It seems though that something else that has never done it before affects my taste buds especially in regards to red wine (Pinot Noir, Cab, and Red Table).   

Anyone experience this or have any clues about it?  I've done several searches and cannot find anything on-line and am hoping someone here can help me out.",wine,1569691683,bluepivot,5,3,True,2019-09-28

This one is from [Wild Horse](https://imgur.com/a/4bxqYHN) in the Santa Maria Valley; their 'Cheval Sauvage' seems to be something of a flagship bottling (but I can't for sure tell if this is the case). 

First things first - I picked this up for $19.99 in my local PA state liquor store. It ordinarily retails for ~$65 so when I noticed it, I had to buy a bottle to see for myself. 

Right off the bat, I don't think it's a $65 wine. BUT, for $19.99 it's wonderful value. I decanted this and let it breathe for 1 1/2 hours before pouring my first taste. 

Nose: Initially a bit shy but started to open up and reveal some really interesting notes, notably sage, cloves, nutmeg, gamey/beef notes, rhubarb.

Palate: Largely followed the nose with an initial burst of sour cherry and pomegranate. Slight gaminess brings balance and intrigue. No means a fruit bomb, tannins are quite soft, and perhaps to its credit, things seems to all be in balance.

6,"Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for three dishes: Cod with Veggies in papillot / Crepes with Mushrooms, Spinach and Leek / Zucchini Rolls Casserole stuffed with smoked Mozzarella in Tomato Sauce","For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals.

I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see how wine can fit food. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but we will use the title components.

The first is Cod with Veggies in Papillot, a light dish.

The second is Crepes with Mushrooms, Spinach and Leek (italian seasoning).

The final one is a Zucchini Roll Casserole stuffed with smoked Mozzarella in Tomato Sauce

What would you recommend or which advice can you give for good pairings? What tastes to focus on, where to look for inspiration. Many and varied suggestions are welcome! I'm mostly looking to learn to be honest.

My own idea was a light and refreshing white wine with the Cod. For instance, I have a couple of whites I'm afraid have gone bad but that I'd like to try out. These are ""2012 La Capitana Barrel Reserve Vina La Rosa Chardonnay"", a ""2012 Van Zylshof Chenin Blanc"", a ""2012 Castillo de Correa Sauvignon Blanc"" and a ""2013 Arniston Bay Sauvignon-Blanc -Semillion"". If they all turn out to be bad I'd dare try a ""2013 Domaine de la Jasse Vin de Pays d'Oc Barrique Blanc"" or a ""2013 3 Winner Riesling trocken Deep Roots"". Naturally, I'm open to other suggestions!

For the crepes, I'm not sure. A pinot noir could work I guess. Likewise as above, I have a ""2005 Thibault Liger-Belair Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Gruenchers"" that I've read should be drunk sooner rather than later. However, I'd be open to other suggestions. Since it is with crepes, a dough, heavier or stronger fare might be suitable?

For the final one - it is a stronger cheese (Smoked Mozz has a golden exterior and more pronounced flavour) so a classic pairing could be a nice Italian. I do have some of those, such as a ""Torr√¶ del Sale
Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 2011"". But same as before, looking for suggestions and feedback.",wine,1569522850,Kalenden,2,2,True,2019-09-26

5,Blind tastings - what could the varietals have been?,"Hi guys, I just sat at the Indian Sommelier Championship where we had to taste 2 wines blind. Here are the tasting notes I got. Could you help me decipher the varietals? 

White:
Pale straw colour. Medium plus aroma intensity. Aromas of citrus (sweet lime/bergamot, lemon), tropical fruits like melon. White flowers and some minerality in the background, but only light hints. On the palate, the fruit structure was ripe, high acidity. Bit more minerality on the palate but otherwise same fruits. Palate was also medium bodied (slightly creamy but not proper buttery/oily like a full MLF), medium minus alcohol. Finish was medium plus. I guessed Loire chenin but realised later that I'm most definitely wrong because of the aromatic nature. Grapes are obviously, never revealed, but they told us it's definitely not sauvignon blanc (which half of the people thought it is) or Viognier.

Red:
Medium to pale ruby in colour. Medium plus intensity of aromas. Red fruits (raspberry, cherry), some black cherry, earthy (forest floor), game-like. Palate was light bodied, medium alcohol, low tannins (structured), and medium acidity. Medium finish. The medium acidity and alcohol was really surprising. I was expecting a NZ or other such cool climate pinot noir but ended up writing slightly warmer, Oregon pinot (again, could've got that completely wrong).

Do they tend to be sweeter or more concentrated, or do they just have a greater body due to the higher alcohol content resulting from fermenting the sugar down to more traditional levels of sweetness?

I am also looking at using the Cabernet/Merlot stemmed glasses as sort of an all-purpose glass for red wines - including pinots, syrah, etc.

That said, I would still appreciate a barometer as to the significance of perfectly matched glassware.

&amp;#x200B;

**Purchase Options:**

* I can get the **Heart to Heart** glassware as a 4-pack for $42 on sale. I understand this is for new world wines.
* I can get the **Extreme** glassware as a 4 pack for $63 on sale. I understand this is also for new world wines, and is an upgraded version of the Heart to Heart.
* I can get the **Vinum** 4 pack for $60 standard price. I understand this is for old world wines and is the standard entry level glass.
* I can get the **Performance** 4 pack for $84 on sale. I understand this is the highest level version of glasses for old world wine.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions are as follows:**

1. Is it much of a big deal to use a New World Wine glass to drink Old World Wine?
2. Are the differences between these glasses worth thinking too hard about for an intermediate wine drinker?
3. Are there any quality differences in terms of build/durability I should be aware of?
4. Is the cabernet glass the best ""all arounder"" if I plan to drink multiple varieties of red from the glass?

&amp;#x200B;

Budget is a consideration, as is storage space.

I am **leaning towards the Heart 2 Heart for $42 for 4 glasses** as it seems it would probably be perfectly fine to drink old world wines from, and that the differences moving to ""extreme"" may not be that notable? BUT - clearly I am detailed enough to post here first to ask for advice and help! So fire away, please :)

Alcohol can impede the processing, transportation, and absorption of essential nutrients. Some people with alcohol use disorder also have inadequate food intake. This can lead to deficiencies in:

vitamin E, vitamins B6 and B12. thiamine. niacin, folate

1,Napa / Sonoma / Healdsburg trip for my wife‚Äôs 40th birthday.,"  

Wow. What a trip. We tasted some amazing wines. I love wine, I have a hard time with the ‚Äútasting notes‚Äù portion. I feel like a generally have a good pallet, I can tell you good wine vs bad, but the why is tough for me. So, instead of tasting notes, I‚Äôm going to give some reviews on the wineries we visited. (I‚Äôll also clue you into which bottles were my favorite, even if I can‚Äôt explain why)

Day 1: Right from the airport to Limerick Lane.

We‚Äôve been to this winery before, actually one of my wife‚Äôs favorites. Mostly because of the host Andy. This was an amazing place to taste wine, we toured the vineyard, sat out back and enjoyed some great Zin. The wine here was all spectacular. 

We tried: 2018 Rose, 2018 Cole Ranch Riesling, 2017 Estate Blend 2017 Katz-Ponzo, 1023 and the 1910 Block Zin. We purchased a bottle of the Hail Mary to take home for the night. 

We started with the Rose, Limerick Lane is known for their Rose, and deservedly so, very tasty. The Riesling, a new wine to the vineyard was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had, well balanced and hints of honey. The Estate Blend was quite good, especially for the price. The Katz-Ponzo took the crown as ‚Äúbest wine of the day for me‚Äù. 

Andy sent us home a magnum of the Rose for my wife‚Äôs birthday and it somehow tasted twice as good as the normal 750ml. We purchased a bottle of the Hail Mary to go, a great story if you ever make it the winery and that was exceptional as well. 

Total Haul for the Cellar: 3 2017 Estate Blend, 2 1910 Block Zin, 4 Katz-Ponzo Zin, 2 Cole Ranch Riesling and 1 bottle of the Rose.

2,Help with wine pairing/order of wines,"TL;DR- My wine pairings for an evening of entertaining are out of order for the traditional ‚Äòlighter-to-heavier‚Äô order. Will this mess things up?

I‚Äôm entertaining guests this weekend, and because people will be arriving at different times, I will have hors d‚Äôoeuvres that I want to pair with a white wine (Chardonnay?) while everyone is chilling before dinner begins in earnest. 

Problem is, the dinner I‚Äôm making (a moroccan stew) is a little difficult to pair with wine, at least for me, so I‚Äôm thinking a Gew√ºrztraminer or a riesling, which will be lighter than what I‚Äôd like to serve with the pre-dinner stuff‚Ä¶. is this a problem? Will it mess with palates? 

We‚Äôll probably move on to red after dinner, but the pairings for the first two courses seem‚Ä¶. out of order. Thoughts? No big deal?

My husband received this bottle of 1990 Pol Rogers Champagne for his birthday from his Dad with the conditions that A) it be opened that evening to be shared with everyone and B) that I as a WSET student opened it. 

We chilled it. I took off the cage, and when I rotated the bottle felt the cork move very easily. It gave a good sounding ""Pop"", not a quiet, gentle one and there was no spillage. The cork seemed to be in okay condition, no striations or wet cardboard smell but as soon as I poured the wine, the color told me it was off. The smell was strong (apple I think - I didn't take tasting notes and realized later it was a missed opportunity) but it tasted like a strong, very dry apple cider - but more sour. We toasted as a group, everyone had a sip and agreed it was past its prime and we couldn't drink it. My brother in law was so sweet, he was excited to have such an old bottle of wine that he drank his glass. I love champagne but just couldn't bring myself to finish my glass, even after hearing his point of view.

1,Advice on wine storage in the South,"Thanks in advance for your opinions. I know a wine fridge is the obvious play-it-safe answer here, but I'd like to avoid buying one. 

Here are the problems. I live in New Orleans. We don't have basements here. Also it's hot af during our five month long summer. My house has central AC but during summer we set it around 79 to keep the energy bill tolerable. Not sure how much cooler we could get the house in the height of NOLA heat anyway. 

I'm by no means a collector, but I do tend to buy a handful of bottles when I go to the wine shop because there's always another intriguing bottle that wasn't on my list and I have poor wine impulse control. Y'all get me. I'm not buying any bottles to age. I'm usually buying moderately nice bottles (between $15-$50, $20-$35 is where I usually live) to drink within 2-3 months tops. 

After giving it some thought, the place I chose to store my wine is a small, windowless room with a dedicated AC vent. It might be the coolest room in our house, but that isn't saying much. But, I figure, the temperature is at least fairly consistent there during the summer, it's far from the kitchen/stove, the bottles won't be disturbed there, and there's no sun exposure. And if the longest I'm keeping a bottle before drinking it is only a few months, a steady 79 degrees shouldn't do too much damage, right?

- Is this characteristic of Southern Rh√¥ne wine? I.e. does most Southern Rh√¥ne have at least some hint of Brett?
- What confused me is that none of the expert or amateur reviews (Vivino/CellarTracker) mentioned this at all. If one bottle is heavy on Brett, will all bottles of the same vintage have the same? Or does it vary bottle to bottle, or barrel to barrel?
- Are some people more sensitive to Brett than others?",wine,1568519363,JarndyceAndJarndyce,6,7,True,2019-09-14

1,Ahhhhhh- sooooo?,"I'm pretty confused why more people don't use Ah-sos. I started as a server/expediter, &amp; I'm just an industry guy that got out of f&amp;b into the operational side of luxury hospitality, and lucky enough to make some wine with a friend in the ribbon ridge Ava of Willamette Valley, and as well as on our Hotel property nearby.  I'm really just an enthusiast &amp; hobbyist in every respect.

So even with restaurants I'm involved in, have been involved in, or who have friends that are involved in them, no one uses an Ah-so to open wine.

it is literally the only thing I will use to open any wine ever, because it is so easy, and effortless, ll.

&amp; I've got to wonder if I'm stupid or doing something wrong, or what the deal is? Like, why would something I perceive to be the most effortless way to properly open wine end up being relegated to the history books?

how do you open wine? What do you use? I remember the sharper image olmoment of the rabbit, and all those ridiculously bulky and huge edifices that sat around taking up space in your kitchen.

I've been out of the property-level food and beverage game for a long time, because I am old and becoming extinct. So am I missing something?

Is it a regional thing, because I'm on the west coast of the United States? Is it that labor is really hard to train, &amp; the majority of people that don't have experience serving rather use a corkscrew? I remember lifer servers saving up tips to buy cherry wood and titanium wine keys, and I always respected that, but I never understood why they wouldn't use an Ah-So?? 

I am sort of hoping it's a regional thing, and it's just my unfortunate reality that I'm in a place where no one cares about them.

Long story short, for me the Ah-So is by far the easiest and simplest way to open any single given bottle of wine, whether profoundly expensive and rare, or new and delightfully drinkable.

Although I'm underaged here in the USA I've had the opportunity to taste some really incredible wines, as well as meet some stellar industry professionals, which have all inspired me to want to go further.

Now here's where I'm looking for some advice. I've got one more year until I can legally drink, buy wine myself, or even sit for the introductory sommelier exam. So my idea is that I'll be taking an academic approach to my learning in the meantime. That said, what should I be reading? 

I'm already working through Kevin Zraly's wine book (as it's required reading for my job), and am thinking of adding on Jancis Robinson's Oxford Companion or her Concise Wine Companion. What else can I add to my reading list?

Lastly, if anyone has just general life and wine advice for a young one like me, then that would also be much appreciated. Thanks!",wine,1567876508,d_25,12,4,True,2019-09-07

As  a novice, I'm looking to learn about suitable matches.
If you disagree, feel free to suggest other wines. I have a weird cellar (inherited) but might be able to match if you suggest plenty!

A 2011 Terra d'Oro Winery Barbera with a Beef Cottage Lasagna (recipe: https://www.karlasnordickitchen.com/lasagna-with-ricotta-cheese-on-cabbage-shells/ with cottage cheese instead of ricotta). 
Idea is to match the wine, an Italian grape grown by an American Winery, with an Italian dish with heavy American influences.  

A 2011 Folie √† Deux Chardonnay Russian River Valley with Mushroom Broccoli Stir Fry (Indian) with Naan (Recipe: http://www.fullscoops.net/2017/04/broccoli-and-mushroom-stirfry.html).
Idea is a refreshing Chardonnay to counter the spices inherent to an Indian seasoning and Chardonnay because it matches well with Mushrooms.

A Reuilly Pinot Noir 2009 with Lentil Burgers and Pumpkin Miso Puree (burgers are pretty pure lentils and recipe for pumpkin: http://www.junedarville.com/pumpkin-puree-recipe.html)
Idea is to match the earthiness of a pinot noir with the earthiness of lentils and pumpkin and a Loire pinot noir because they are generally more fresh and rose-like to match the asian miso taste.

Price point: $150-200

Wines we generally like: Zinfandels &amp; Barberas.  Generally we like reds, but I know he wanted to try a solid sauvignon blanc and to start branching out to French red wines.

Notes we generally dislike: nothing too dry, nothing too mineral

Also, we will be cracking this bottle open at the end of the month, so preferably a wine that's ready to go.

8,**Monthly Wine Challenge - September 2019 Selection Post!**,"Hi Everyone,

Welcome to the September challenge selection post!  It looks like Augusts selection was popular!  I hope this months selection can prove to be just as popular!  Speaking of which, its hard to believe that August is gone, and for those of us up north, the summer is starting to wind down.  Hopefully for our southern friends, the weather is starting to look up.  So, I thought this months grape would work well for everyone!  And that brings me to our selection this month.    So, without any delay, our selection this month is:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Country: Any South Africa\*

\*\*Variety/Varietal: Sauvignon Blanc\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this is the first time I have had sauvignon blanc since I took over the challenge, and only a handful of time visiting South Afrtica.  So hopefully we can all find something to toast the change of the seasons.   Cheers my firends!  I look forward to reading your notes!

&amp;#x200B;

So, just like with past MWC entries, us on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.).

I'm storing wine in my basement until I have an actual long-term storage facility built and I have a question about temps and RHs.

Not bad, but that average is an average of a LOT of peaks of 64.5F down to about 57F. RH bounces between 65% and 80%. This happens a few times a day. My questions are; does the fluctuation matter if the average is within spec, does the rate of change matter (it might take an hour or two to fluctuate from the min to max and vice versa), and same questions for the relative humidity?

2,John Szabo on wine scores (wine align),"Here is a excerpt from today's wine align newsletter.  Not that this is really news for anyone on this sub, but it's interesting to hear the frustration from a respected critic (in Canada at least)

""I really didn‚Äôt want to re-open this discussion; we‚Äôre content at WineAlign to try to keep some semblance of meaning in our scoring and suffer the consequences from advertisers and dwell in anonymity in the murky wine marketing world. We‚Äôre working for you after all, not advertisers. ¬†But I came across yet another ludicrously high-scoring wine at the media tasting for this release that made me angry. It‚Äôs a 2017 Tuscan Red ($16.95) rated 98 points by Luca Maroni, an Italian reviewer notorious for his scarcely fathomable scores. Even the platinum medals we awarded during the National Wine Awards of Canada, the best of the best, didn‚Äôt come near to such a large number.

When it comes to impossibly big numbers, Maroni‚Äôs in a rarified league of his own, outdoing even other notorious high scorers like James Halliday and James Suckling. And the wine? It‚Äôs a rather thick, chewy, rustic red, slightly sweet, a commercial proposition. It has wide appeal no doubt, but hardly 2% from perfection. I‚Äôd have to think that even the winemaker who made the wine was scratching his head upon learning of the score, perhaps even giggling, before turning despondent and maybe even upset that he has already reached the pinnacle of his career, and that whatever future wines he might make, he can only do better by the smallest of margins. Maroni has taken his dreams away.

Or maybe, he just ignores the number, knowing that it is meaningless (after of course using it to sell the crap out of the wine), much like I suggest you should do.

Maroni‚Äôs trick is that he apparently bases his scores on a ‚Äúquality ‚Äì quantity index‚Äù, presumably meaning that this a decent wine made in impressively industrial quantities. It‚Äôs a near-perfect combination. But you‚Äôd have to read the tiny print on the sticker to learn this and work it out for yourself. The trouble is, the sticker looks a lot like every other bottle score sticker. Shoppers are stopped by the big number, and I guarantee you that precious few look more closely ‚Äì it‚Äôs a calculated scam.""",wine,1567124915,liquid_massage,7,10,True,2019-08-29

5,How to best experience a driving trip through the Rh√¥ne Valley,"Hope this is OK to post here. I thought about /r/travel but reckon I can get better info here given my specific interest and I am sure many of the wine pros and experts here have made this journey already. 

Spouse and I are going to the south of France next month. It‚Äôs our third visit to the country, but our first to this region, and our first wine-focused visit. We‚Äôll be in Nice for a short period of time and then will have a car and will drive up the Rh√¥ne Valley to Lyon where we take a train back to Paris. We will be based in Avignon for a week where obviously we‚Äôll focus on the southern Rh√¥ne before driving north. 

About 20 years ago we got interested in wine and wanted to not be so intimidated ordering out at restaurants and we picked up a copy of Johnson/Robinson‚Äôs World Atlas. Perhaps because Rh√¥ne seemed less mystifying and more accessible than Bordeaux and Burgundy, that‚Äôs where we began our study and tasting. And today, the vast majority of French wine we consume is from this region. In the south we are most interested (dare I say knowledgeable?) in Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape, Gigondas, and Vacqueras. In the north, Condrieu, C√¥te Rotie, and Hermitage. I am sure we will discover more as we move about and we will be open to whatever comes our way. 

With that background out of the way, I am interested to learn more about the culture of visitng wineries. I am from the DC area and there are lots of wineries outside the beltway and closer to the mountains. While we love to visit, the culture seems to be overwhelmingly ‚Äúlet‚Äôs rent a bus or limo and be driven from winery to winery and get wasted.‚Äù There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with that, but we are more interested in tasting and actually learning and these places are usually so crowded on weekends so as to make this a near impossibility. Not to mention, we observe a ‚Äúhell no‚Äù policy for consuming any alcohol and drivng a car so having a spit bucket is a necessity. Are these typical in French wineries?

I have the understanding that is not really the culture in France, and that is great. But I‚Äôm not sure how to visit if that makes sense. We use Airbnb a lot in our travels and there are many Wine Experiences we can book and we plan on that once perhaps twice. But I am wondering more about our driving around. Do wineries typically have hours posted? If so, can we generally go in for a visit if we pass one? My only frame of reference was our last visit to Normandy and Britanny and the many cideries there. Many had hours posted but the several we visited really weren‚Äôt situated for tours or tastings. Rather, their posted hours we to stop in and buy cider. One or two showed us around and let us taste, but I think that was only because they weren‚Äôt busy and maybe they felt bad for us. Are most wineries typically appointment only? Are they generally set up to expext inqusitive visitors?

Thanks for reading all of this - any information would be much appreciated. Also, given the specific regions I mentioned, if there‚Äôs anything specific you would recommend we do or visit, please do share.

My wife and I got a bottle of Lo Triolet Vall√©e d‚ÄôAoste Pinot Gris while at a restaurant in New Jersey and it was the best Pinot Grigio I ever have. I became interested in wines about a year ago and since been working on trying many different varieties and regions.

So obviously I want to add a few bottles to our wine fridge. However, besides a few local wine shops around NY/NJ, you have to be in Italy to find it. I found the importers website but not many details. Most websites don't have it listed, and the very few that do within the US don't have it in stock. I did find a website called Tannico based in Italy that ships to the US, but shipping is around $50 unless I buy over $189 worth. 

Any other ideas on tracking this down? I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth a shot to call the few local wine stores in New York that have it in stock to see if they ship out of state. I live in Virginia, otherwise I‚Äôd just buy it locally. Wondering what else I can do.

6,#wino) need: tips for great white wines from Germany that fit my taste; preferably Muscat or Sauvignon Blanc et Sauvignon Gris cuvee,"Hello all,

I live in the Rheingau/Rheinhessen region in Germany and wanted to ask you for your best tips for wines from around here, or Germany in general, that fit my taste (or, if you really have great tips from elsewhere; say, Austria, Switzerland or Italy; I‚Äòll happily take those as well)

While Rheinhessen is renown mostly for its Riesling, it‚Äôs sadly a wine I mostly don‚Äôt enjoy too much (exceptions granted), but we‚Äôre also doing Scheurebe here, which I mostly like, even at lower price points (wine is not that expensive around here - bottles for direct consumption from local wineries start at 3,50‚Ç¨, 5-8‚Ç¨ is most common, 10-15‚Ç¨ is a medium price, everything above 20‚Ç¨ is considered rather high, at least for white wines that aren‚Äòt meant for storage, that is).  

I also really, really like muscat blanc √† petits grains (Gelber Muskateller), which sadly isn‚Äôt all that common in Germany, but you can find it occasionally (it‚Äòs also not a very stable wine: in good years, it‚Äòs great on its own, it bad years, it‚Äòs a loss and there is no inbetween). I know it‚Äòs far more common in Austria, and Southern Europe, but sadly Austrian wines are not that easy to get here and i haven‚Äòt seen any, say, Italian ones anywhere  in wine boutiques around here yet, which tend to be more local.

I‚Äòm neutral/hit or miss towards Pinot Blanc and Pinot gris, which are two other grapes that are quite common around here (Grauer und Wei√üer Burgunder). I tend to prefer Pinot Gris to Pinot Blanc and really like when they have that typical apple like aroma. I also tend to like Pinot Gris ros√© (and Pinot noir ros√©), but that‚Äòs not the topic here. I do not enjoy when a wine is too acidic, which is the case for most dry rieslings here (which is the most common Riesling form you can buy here).

I found out that I tend to like German wines better when they are from the Baden/Kaiserstuhl region, although of course the range varies. 

The following wines are ones in my budget range that I really liked. Not all of them are from Germany, but it may still give you an impression. A conclusion of common characteristics is added below the list.

German: Schloss Ortenberg 2012 Sauvignon Blanc et Sauvignon Gris trocken (=dry). I still dream of it 6 years after last drinking it, but it‚Äòs sold out whenever I try to find bottles of that year or newer ones. It‚Äòs a quite unusual cuvee here, sadly, but it went together really well. It‚Äòs from the Kaiserstuhl/Baden region. I‚Äòd like more cuvees of these two, no matter where they‚Äòre from - so if you know any, please share that here.

Italian: Scaia Bianco - Garganega/Chardonnay cuvee from the Veneto region. Garganega was an interesting experience I can‚Äòt find too often in shops around here, and not all wineries produce that same citrus-y, slightly almond-y aroma for their wines, some are just flat and short, which is really sad. I‚Äòd love more aromatic and long-lived Garganega tips, if you have any. 

German: Weingut Diehl Gelber Muskateller halbtrocken (it‚Äòs a regional winery from the Rheingau/Rheinhessen region, and there are several Diehls and Diels over here, some of whom offer several versions of gelber Muskateller = Muscat Blanc √† Petits grains, so probably won‚Äòt indicate much that I listed it here). It‚Äòs my go-to wine when eating regional specialties. It‚Äòs also quite nice when you‚Äòre on a budget (a bottle‚Äòs just around 7‚Ç¨ and it‚Äòs rich in flavour and long-lived).

Austrian: Scheiblhofer Gelber Muskateller trocken. The 2017 one was really good, the 2018 one is crap, sadly. It‚Äòs also a really big conventional winery that‚Äôs commonplace in Austria, but I don‚Äòt mind as long as the wine tastes good.

German: Juliusspital W√ºrzburger Abtsleite Muskateller Kabinett medium dry (another Muscat wine, I see a pattern there) (belongs to the VDP, so a big and commonplace association of producers in Germany). Not something I drink often, but a quite nice muscat wine.  It‚Äòs from Franken, another wine region in Germany.

Several kinds of Scheurebe I sadly didn‚Äòt write down, but they were mostly from the Mosel and Kaiserstuhl region and dry or medium dry, not sweet.

and...

Schloss Vollrads Riesling Kabinett feinherb. (Belongs to the VDP as well), probably one of the few rieslings I somewhat liked (which is weird because Scheurebe, which I like, is a Riesling x Bouquet Blanc breed), but if I have other options, I‚Äòll always choose them over this one. 

I also have tasted some nice rieslings from small local wineries (and liked Ke√üler best to this day, I think) - I do prefer medium dry Riesling to dry Riesling, apparently, but only if medium dry doesn‚Äòt equal super sweet, and only if dry means super acidic (which sadly is often the case). I tend to like fruity notes (citrus, red berries, black berries, stone fruit) and floral notes, as well as occasional grassy notes. I prefer my Riesling to be ‚Äûsofter‚Äú rather than pungent/pronouncedly acidic. Some mild tartness/bitterness is okay though. I do not like my Riesling to be super lightweight and leaving a ‚Äûvast‚Äú, ‚Äûempty‚Äú feeling in my mouth. 

The worst Riesling I ever drank was the Martinsthaler Wildsau, shortly followed by the Kloster Eberbach H√∂llenberg and Kloster Eberbach Neroberg. 

Both Kloster Eberbach Rauenthaler Riesling classic in dry and medium dry are quite nice though, especially the medium dry one. Kloster Eberbach is another VDP winery, and from my region.

What all those white wines have in common is that while they are on the dryer to medium dry side, they‚Äòre not super sour. They aren‚Äòt, however, sweet. They all tend to have fruity aroma (citrus, pear or apple, mirabelle plum but without the sugary overload, and peach), as well as a typical muscat note for the Muscat wines which I enjoyed a lot. They‚Äòre all rather fresh/refreshing, and tend to be rather floral. While I have nothing against mineral notes, and even enjoy them, it‚Äòs usually not something that‚Äòs found too strongly in the wines I mentioned - but sadly something that often goes together with super acidic Riesling (which I don‚Äòt enjoy because super acidic = instant gastric inflammation for me). I also don‚Äòt understand why dry Riesling tends to equal super sour Riesling around here, which is a shame, because I enjoy dry to medium dry wines and it‚Äòs just ruined by excess acid. Medium dry Riesling from my region also often tends to be too sweet, but that‚Äòs just a recent fad from the wineries that I‚Äòve noticed. I guess it‚Äòs because it sells better, and maybe it‚Äòll change again in a few years. All of the wines listed have a nice, extended length when drinking them (and everything else would be betrayal). 


I have never yet tried to drink Dessert wines, which I think is what‚Äòs usually done with Muscat Blanc √† petits grains in warmer regions (France, Italy, Spain, Portugal), but I would rather prefer to get tips for ‚Äûregular‚Äú wine for now. If, however, there‚Äòs a good Muscat dessert wine in the price range I listed below, I‚Äòm glad to try that to see if I like it.

As I‚Äôm a student, my budget is fairly limited, but I‚Äôm willing to spend up to 20‚Ç¨ for a bottle of white wine that‚Äôs meant for consumption and not cellaring (which for the Wineries in my region is a rather high price - most range from 5-13‚Ç¨ for their non-cellared wines, with some exceptions here and there). I‚Äòd prefer if it were somewhere around 10-15‚Ç¨ though. 

I‚Äòm open to try French, Spanish and Portuguese white wines, which I haven‚Äòt tried before, but I‚Äòd also like to try other German, Swiss, Austrian or Italian wines, preferably from the region I live in (Rheingau/Rheinhessen). If you know a Riesling that‚Äòs not a sourpuss and rich in fruity aroma while not being sweet, I‚Äòll gladly try that as well because I‚Äòm so tired of living in *the* region of Rieslings while I mostly can‚Äòt  enjoy them.",wine,1566987110,rose_cactus,4,1,True,2019-08-28

11,Pairing Wines from a list with three dishes: Mushroom Pepper Frittata / Chicken Eggplant Lasagna / Bean Tofu Sweet Potato Dish,"For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals.
I'm aware we cook relatively non-standard but I'm trying to gain experience and see where and how what wine fits with what. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components.

The first is a Mushroom Pepper (Egg White) Frittata (Recipe: only in dutch, sorry!)

The second is a Chicken Eggplant Lasagna (Recipe: http://sprinklesandsauce.com/eggplant-chicken-lasagna)

The final one is a Bean Tofu Sweet Potato Dish (Recipe: https://jenniferskitchen.com/2013/12/sweet-potato-and-black-bean-scramble.html).  

What would you recommend? We have a fairly varied cellar that is way too old (inherited). It can be found underneath, if you are willing to have a look, ignore the dates on the right side, it is as a reminder that they should've been drunk by a certain date. Of course, I prefer to drink the wines that should be drunk sooner.

Personally, for the Frittata I was thinking of either the Chemin des Papes C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Ros√© or Pink Elephant		The Perfect Rose.

For the Chicken Eggplant Lasagna, I was thinking of the 2012 Frati Bianchi Sparapani Le Terre or 2011 Terra d'Oro Winery Barbera.

No clue for the Bean Tofu Sweet Potato Dish.

However, the one grape I feel I've yet to experience properly is Nebbiolo.

What I want to know is- are there any producers of Barolo, Barbaresco, even Alto Piemonte, who produce higher-quality Nebbiolo- unmistakably Nebbiolo- that can be drunk fairly young, say with only a cpl years of bottle age rather than usual 7-10 years or more? I've had a couple of inexpensive langhe Nebbiolos that tasted open and fresh, but to me they tasted like any other light red wine, not much different than a gamay or even light sangiovese- I've also bought a 2013 Marcheshi di Barolo, but opening felt like an utter waste; totally closed, light red fruit, tasty but not even close to worth $50.

My firstborn son will be born in a few days, and I am considering buying a bottle of wine that can be kept as an investment, or with a view to drink in many years.

I am really trying to find a bottle that will increase in value. I understand that it's not easy task to pick a 1976 Grange Hermitage back in 1976 but wondered if anyone had an idea of a current wine that might hold up in future. I have no maximum budget for this.

6,Help for managing aging wine cellar,"Hi, (this is a repost but looking for some more advice)

I‚Äôve recently gotten the responsibility to manage an old/aging wine cellar of over 400 bottles and want to treat it right but also want to expand it with interesting new additions. However, before I can add to it and fill gaps, I need to get a grip on all the bottles already there. Hence, the cellar needs a serious overhaul. I‚Äôve gotten it completely scanned in into Vivino and exported as an excel sheet uploaded on Google Sheets here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12PIPiJEky8xgMRCaEpgOO4GBzRaE7260atTdrp2Ottw/edit?usp=sharing

First, I‚Äôd like to determine which bottles should just be thrown out - too old to be drunk, likely acid, ‚Ä¶ - these bottles I‚Äôd just throw out or use in some kind of big tasting event. Second, I‚Äôd like to determine which bottles are just inferior/budget/unlikely to be quality. These would be my back-up bottles, or used for cooking/recipes. Third, I‚Äôd like to determine which bottles are likely to be high quality and should be taken special care of. These would be for celebrations.

Finally, any and all advice to help me manage this is appreciated. I am starting in wine and would actually like to buy new and exciting wines but first need to better manage this existing, neglected, cellar I‚Äôve come into possession of. So any advice is welcome!

Underneath I have a list of wines that I checked through CellarTracker and which I believe could go (don't take the text too literally). I was thinking of just throwing out all the 'budget wines' and perhaps some of the ""To drink soon"" ones.

6,PSA: Last Bottle marathon tomorrow 12 PM EST,"I've posted this before, so here's from last time...

For those who don't know, the marathon is pretty much Last Bottle's inventory clearance, where bottles stay up until they sell out (or it's just been up for awhile, in which case you can expect to see it again). Everything ships free, so it's a great way just to try a few wines/regions/styles that you wouldn't have tried before. Or a great way to load up on some favorites/classics.

The wines vary tremendously in price, region, and style. Screaming Eagle, first growth Bordeaux, cheap prosecco, dry and sweet german rieslings, vintage port, etc. Some bottles are sold in extremely small quantities and sell out before you can even hit refresh, others stay up longer.

I would definitely tune into the first hour or so of the marathon, where they usually run through some great stuff to draw interest.  But, it's always worth tuning in.   

Because things sell out so fast, I would operate under the assumption that everything is at least wine-searcher lowest price, and occasionally by a decent ~10% margin. It can be risky to check the price/reviews because things will sell out in seconds.  But, on the other hand, it's also risky in general to not check review/pricing... 

For example, if you want to try German riesling, then snap up any JJ Prum or Schloss Lieser single vineyard stuff as soon as you see it, because it won't last.

7,PSA: LastBottleWines.com Marathon Sale Starts Tomorrow! (Here's $10 credit for 1st time shoppers),"For anyone who doesn't know, www.LastBottleWines.com is a pretty interesting, cool online wine store that typically only sells one wine/cuvee per day at what is usually a very discounted rate.  Once that wine sells out, it's gone and they'll post a new offer up the following day.

However, during August 22 and 23 they are having their always anticipated Marathon Sale.  The Marathon Sale is like their normal business model, but on speed.  The offer a small amount of bottles of a wine at a discount price and once it sells out (which can be in seconds or minutes), they post the next offer.  You keep kitting refresh to see the new offers.  One of the best things about this sale -- every order comes with FREE SHIPPING (even if you only buy one bottle).   They offer everything from random $10 bottles that you haven't heard of to Cristal and other very high end bottles. 

I personally love this sale and use it to stock up on daily drinkers and special bottles a like.  I've never received a bottle from LastBottle that I didn't like or that I didn't think was worth the price I paid or more.  I've also bought several really great bottles from LastBottle. 
 The biggest downside is that since this sale is so massive compared to the size of their operation, it takes a very long time to ship the orders (maybe 1 - 2 months?), but since it's super hot anyway, I don't think that should be a concern.

If you sign up with my referral link, you get $10 credit (and I get credit as well), so you can even get a completely free bottle of wine since there's free shipping and they'll offer various bottles for around $10.

Simply put, I would like some suggestions on where to start? I‚Äôm from the U.K. btw so I will focus on pounds.

- Is there a price range I should be looking for to ensure I‚Äôm getting a good representation of that variety/regions?

- Should I go for the more popular varieties/regions first and the move on to the more unknown ones? If so what would they be? I don‚Äôt have any preference to anything I want to appreciate the difference for myself and then decide what‚Äôs would be my preference

- For anyone in the UK, what would be a good website to buy wine from? I prefer trying it on my own with good music on, that‚Äôs when I can take notes and really enjoy it best, so a wine bar wouldn‚Äôt be ideal.

Perhaps due to my whisky background my questions don‚Äôt really relate much to wine, but if there are any wines that would be considered essential to try out I would love to know which ones they are.

&amp;#x200B;

For those curious, here are my tasting notes:

&amp;#x200B;

 Quite pretty pink color with hints of orange and cream around the edges. The smell has classic Cabernet Franc notes: eucalyptus, grilled asparagus, a little bell pepper, and maybe some kale and other salad greens. There is also strawberry and raspberry jam and some walnut. Crisply acidic, and light-bodied, I can imagine this wine going incredibly well with fresh salad. Raspberry, strawberry, and passionfruit dance on the front and mid-palate, with some white pepper, raspberry, broccoli, and cinnamon-like spice on the finish.

&amp;#x200B;

Very complex and appetizing, I could also see this wine turning off some people due to it's green character. The vegetal notes on the finish are a bit unpleasant; but with a salad or some steamed greens, this would pair perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

On the second glass, and after about an hour more of aeration, I noticed pencil lead (graphite) and slight floral notes on the nose, and spearmint on the palate.

10,Advice for visiting Napa Valley for the first time (2-day trip),"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend and I will be visiting Napa Valley for a 2-day trip in late September. It will be our first trip there, and although we like wine alot we do not know very much about it. 

I have read about the Wine Train? It seems somewhat expensive and with mixed reviews. Is it worth it? 

What we are looking for is more an experience in seeing and visiting the beautiful estates and wineries. Learning about their histories and walk around in cellars/caves/gardens rather than sitting in a room sipping wine. Schramsberg seems to be nice and not too expensive. Anywhere else you would recommend? 

What would you recommend doing in Napa Valley for 2 days. We are not like super poor but need to stay within a reasonable budget. 

For AirBnB, do we stay in Napa, Sonoma or somewhere else? Would be nice to live within walking/Uber distance to a great restaurant for the night. 

I have read that people suggest lunch on the countryside - anywhere specific or does every winery have a small bistro to go with it? 

I hope you will help us in putting together a 2-day itinerary. We  look very much forward to visiting!",wine,1566250945,Jesper89,17,3,True,2019-08-19

Apparently, there is a well established tradition making of sparking apple wine for the royals visiting San Sebastian.

However this bottle smelled strongly of bell peppers. After some air both a poured glass and the remaining bottle began to smell strongly of stewed bell peppers.

We've had the exact wine many, many months ago, purchased separately and didn't remember anything about it (i.e. dumping it out). 

We purchased the possibly flawed bottle from Costco in the Denver area a week or two ago and immediately put it in our wine closet (dark and a constant 69 degrees).

TLDR: I developed a wine bottle that aerates straight from the bottle. No waiting around, no messing around with separate pour through aerators or decanters.

Obviously, I see a lot of added benefit from this compared to traditional bottles but would love your opinion.

\- Nice landscape/park/cellar

\- No big groups

4,"Old wines, how to judge","{Question below}

So I've finally convinced my dad to start combing through his wine/drinks cellar in the coming months. 

First order of business was all the specialty beers. He gets them as presents but doesn't really like them, so with a heavy heart I've poured dozens of beers in the sink. 

Next up was the wine. I should preface this by saying my dad does enjoy good wine, but it's never been a deep hobby. His father however (passed away around 1990) was heavily into wine. Some of his wine was passed on to my father and has lived in his wine cellar over the past 30ish years. The wine cellar is decent, fairly constant temperature of perhaps between 12 and 16 degrees C over a year (54 to 61 F, for those of you not into C) and decent humidity.

First we came across quite a few bottles of white. Sylvaner from Germany. I smelled each and tried a few, but all were heavily oxidized and got poured too. On to the reds.

As for the reds, we started with just six bottles and will work through the cellar slowly over months. The following bottles were selected this weekend:

* Chateau Langrane St. Emilion Grand Cru 1985		
* Chateau Tour de Mirambeau Cuvee Passion 2001	
* Chateau Fourcas Hosten Listrac Medoc 1983	
* Chateau Marquis de Terme Margaux 1981	
* Chateau Latour a Pomerol	Pomerol	1993
* Charles Ninot Nuits Saint Georges Premier Cru ‚ÄòLes Didiers‚Äô 1986

The system will be as follows. Open a bottle. Taste. If horrible, cry, dump and open the next one. If drinkable, empty bottle, be happy, wait untill the next day of tryouts.

This weekend we started on the Mirambeau, which was heavily oxidized and got dumped. Then we moved on to the Nuits-Saint-Georges, which was ruined and got poured too. Extra sad, since there's another 4 bottles of this one in the basement. Then we tried the Latour a Pomerol, which was spectacular and got finished with many smiles shared between us. (For tasting notes or pictures, feel free to ask)

**Question**. I've had a few very old bottles of red before, almost always with questionable storage histories and most were bad. Most have a color that is fading. Not the solid purple/dark reds, but more clear towards a lighter red, almost rose color. This seems as if the darker particles have settled at the bottom of the bottle and left the wine clearer. The Latour a Pomerol mentioned above which was still spectacular, still had a color more towards it's original dark red wine color and didnt fade to a clearer rose like color.   
*Is this difference (dark 'standard red wine' vs clearer, lighter rose-ish) any indication of how drinkable the wine will be? And if so, will examining old bottles with a light under it help judge if a bottle is still drinkable?*",wine,1565604110,dubbelep,17,9,True,2019-08-12

This chapter is covered closely in an article the author wrote for Food and Wine; see https://www.foodandwine.com/wine/whats-really-in-your-wine.

After some additional research it looks as though there's no way to truly tell which wines have been compromised/enhanced (pending your view) by wine additives. I certainly understand some of the additives are useful - and even necessary - in order for a consumer to enjoy a wine produced across the globe. I'm not weary of additives such as sulfur, tannins, sugar, or yeast, but things such as vanilla extracts and Mega Purple transformed my idyllic perception that any wine I'm consuming may be more scientifically manufactured. Although the articles I've read on this topic indicate the mass produced wines on the bottom shelf are the typical marks, it seems even mid-high tier wines are as well. 

What are your thoughts on this subject, and how do you try to discern which wines (or producers) utilize the more questionable flavor-changing additives?",wine,1565311431,grux34,13,3,True,2019-08-08

It was the marriage of someone who works in the industry and all of the sauce was chosen for reasons sentimental to the wedded, but it was also basically unlimited in quality and quantity. 

This reminded me of the wine-loving phase I went through a few years ago when I was a hard-up recent grad in London and most fancy wine was well beyond my means. Nevertheless, relaxing in the converted chateau pool with a glass of champagne the next morning, I resolved to sit a WSET 1 exam. 

I should explain that my previous wine-loving phase was borne of working in the wine &amp; spirits dept of Waitrose (a slightly up-market UK supermarket) while at university, then working one Christmas shift at The Wine Society (mostly processing orders, but it is a \*fantastic\* organisation, full of brilliant helpful people, and knowledge just rubs off on you working there). 

Which brings me to the point. **Is there any point in me doing WSET** beyond the vanity of being able to flaunt the pin? I don't and probably won't ever work in the industry, and with the limited knowledge I've picked up and some guesswork, I've passed WSET 1 and 2 online practice tests with no studying whatsoever (not entirely sure how accurate they are), the former with \~90% and latter with one mark off a merit. 

I suppose my real questions are, is it worth the significant expense to go to some regular classes and tastings (or the still surprisingly high cost to study online)? Did you feel you learned a lot, well in excess of just learning to pass the multiple-choice exam?

18,Best style of Sherry for a novice?,"Thanks to a certain 90s sitcom, I‚Äôve had a burning desire to try out sherry. I‚Äôm a total novice when it comes to wine of any kind. I‚Äôm not much older than legal drinking age and most of my expertise is beer and whiskey-centric. 

My local Total Wine only stocks a few brands. Most notably Osborne, Don Benigno, and Harveys (just Bristol Cream I think), so it‚Äôll be one of those three. The two former brands offer pretty much all of the major styles of sherry (Fino, Amontillado, etc.). I‚Äôm looking to spend no more than $30, which shouldn‚Äôt be a problem given what I‚Äôve seen on their website. 

So for all of you sherry experts out there: of the major styles, which would you recommend for a newcomer looking to try it out for the first time? Part of me wants to try something basic like Bristol Cream, but I‚Äôve heard some people write it off as cheap and low quality. Keep in mind, at this particular store, it‚Äôs middle of the road as far as price goes, and I have heard some good things about it too. I‚Äôve also been tempted to splurge a little on an Osborne Pedro Ximenez or Amontillado, but I‚Äôm uncertain as to if I want to gamble that much just yet. Sherry may not be my thing. Don Benigno is the cheapest of the three options, but that does make me a little skeptical.

Now, I recently stayed at the house of an older sommelier in Tuscany. He buys a good chianti Classico from a neighbouring vineyard, and we tried several different years of it while I was there.
He advised to decant wines from 2010 and older, with younger ones being drank straight from the bottle (I.e no explicit decanting). 

Now, I know this could be for two reasons: sediments and aeration. He suggested that it should be decanted for a minimum of 10 hours, and preferably more as the wines got older, which suggests that the decanting was not only for removing sediments. 

So my question is essentially: when to decant young wines and when to decant older wines? It is determined by the tannin levels contra acidity or some other relations?",wine,1564993019,nw24,6,6,True,2019-08-05

Hello! When talking to the ower of a local wine store he recommended me to take some personal tasting notes without looking up general tasting notes on the grape/bottle in advance if I want to learn more about wine. Which is what I did! I'd love if some more knowledgable people would give me some general feedback on my notes, point out inaccuracies or inconsistencies or better ways to formulate notes. I'm sorry about the usage of the port glass, I don't have much money to spare and I'll get some free glasses when my WSET 2 course starts in september.

8,HELP finding a Moscato,"Hi everyone,

First time posting here but thought I might get a little help here. My girlfriend recently went to Florence, Italy for a study abroad and came back joking and talking about a Moscato they kept finding everywhere that was extremely sweet (sweeter than that barefoot stuff) that cost next to nothing there. I'm talking candy sweet.

She can't for the life of her remember what brand it is but really wants to get some for her girl friends from the study abroad as a kind of ""remeber all of those crazy nights?"" kind of funny gift.

I know it might be a stretch but, being a member of the bourbon community on Reddit, I know how helpful it can be when you just try. I don't know a lot about wine and I'm sure it's not a brand even Italians drink often but I'm hoping it's known for being cheap and sweet that it might be recognizable. 

Details: has a gold label, skinny neck with a fat bottom, and found in grocery stores and basically anywhere around Florence for ¬£5.

My husband likes a dry red, like Shiraz or Malbec. I've tried to learn to like reds, but I just can't do it. The most tolerable I've come across are blends like Gnarly Head Authentic Red.

The shop had wines from all over Europe and was managed by a local German woman. The bottle I bought caught my eye because it was unlabeled. Just a regular bottle of red wine that packaged with a cork and cage. My memory is not perfect but the woman explained to me that it was an Italian vineyard that was ""not legally allowed"" to distribute in Germany but that she ""knew a guy"". I tried it, loved it and bought it. I have a bottle left. It's a red wine and all I know is that it is Italian and 'illegally' sold in Germany.

Welcome to the August challenge selection post!  I can't believe it is August already!  Summer is half gone here in Canada.  But there are still plenty of hot, sunny days for us up here, and hopefully the weather is agreeable to our friends who are joining us from the southern hemisphere!  And with that in mind, this brings me to our selection this month.  I had a request for this one, and I think it would suit the weather nicely!  So, without any delay, our selection this month is::

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Country: Any (but make sure to read note below!)\*\*

\*\*Variety/Varietal: Rose\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Thats right!  Rose is perfect in almost any weather!  This month the sky is the limit!  whether you love light, barely blushed roses, or luscious deep pink rose, any country is allowed!  Though, perhaps we could look to countries outside France.  For no other reason than this page might turn into post after post of French rose.  Of course, absolutely no problem if it does, I may post one myself :)  Cheers my firends!  I look forward to reading your notes!

&amp;#x200B;

So, just like with past MWC entries, us on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.).

If you are new to wine tasting, [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/2015/08/25/how-to-taste-wine/) has a great article to get you going.  Have fun choosing your wine, and I will see you all on the 15th!",wine,1564707056,PhoenixRising20,12,9,True,2019-08-01

7,Using Nano-Technology in Winemaking,"Hi guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share my point of view with you about an article I have readen this morning. 

A groupe of Australian researchers is studying how this technology can be used to removed smoke, cork taint as well as unwanted aromas in the wine. 

I can fully understand that the wine needs to be sold and the winemaker needs to make money to sustain his business but removing  grape characteristic from the terroir.. I am not quite sure about it.

I had the chance to meet Nicolas Joly in the past and his feeling about what's an AOP ( Appellation d'origine Protegee : French Wien regulation ) means at this moment. Because an AOP's wine is suppose to reveals terroir characteristic and we all know that the major part of the winemaking is coming from the vine management to get healthy fruits. 

What is your feeling about that guys.

5,Help for managing aging wine cellar,"Hi,

I‚Äôve recently gotten the responsibility to manage an old/aging wine cellar of over 400 bottles and want to treat it right but also want to expand it with interesting new additions.
However, before I can add to it and fill gaps, I need to get a grip on all the bottles already there. Hence, the cellar needs a serieus overhaul.
I‚Äôve gotten it completely scanned in into Vivino and exported as an excel sheet uploaded on Google Sheets here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12PIPiJEky8xgMRCaEpgOO4GBzRaE7260atTdrp2Ottw/edit?usp=sharing 

First, I‚Äôd like to determine which bottles should just be thrown out - too old to be drunk, likely acid, ‚Ä¶ - these bottles I‚Äôd just throw out.
Second, I‚Äôd like to determine which bottles are just inferior/budget/unlikely to be quality. These would be my back-up bottles, or used for cooking/recipes.
Third,  I‚Äôd like to determine which bottles are likely to be high quality and should be taken special care of. These would be for celebrations.

Finally, any and all advice to help me manage this is appreciated. I am starting in wine and would actually like to buy new and exciting wines but first need to better manage this existing, neglected, cellar I‚Äôve come into possession of.
So any advice is welcome!

Underneath I have a list of wines that I checked through CellarTracker and which I believe could go (don't take the text too literally).   I was thinking of just throwing out all the 'budget wines' and perhaps some of the ""To drink soon"" ones.

6,Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for three separate dishes: Bean Mushroom Pumpkin Stew / Seitan Broccoli Stir Fry / Meat Cauliflower Eggplant Zucchini Lasagne,"Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for three separate dishes: 

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals. If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components.

The first is a Bean Mushroom Pumpkin Stew (Recipe: https://www.rachaelhartleynutrition.com/blog/2015/11/cannellini-bean-pumpkin-risotto)

The second is a Seitan Broccoli Stir Fry (Recipe: https://www.foxyfolksy.com/beef-broccoli-stir-fry/). The recipe is beef steak but we have seitan steak instead.

The final one is a Meat Cauliflower Eggplant Zucchini Lasagne (Recipe: underneath - the website doesn't work anymore ).   We are unsure if we'll have lamb as the meat in here. Might be beef/mixed/chicken. Sorry for that!

What would you recommend? We have a fairly varied cellar (though some notable wines are lacking). It can be found here, if you are willing to have a look: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12PIPiJEky8xgMRCaEpgOO4GBzRaE7260atTdrp2Ottw/edit?usp=sharing  
The reason I ask for your input is to learn better food/wine pairing from an experienced community!
I have two wines on repour as well: a chablis premier cru durup fourchaume jean and a  2009 Bodegas Hispano-Suizas Quod Superius.

Also, if there are wines that should be drunk sooner rather than later, please let me know.
Also, if there are wines that should be drunk sooner rather than later, please let me know.
Also, if there are wines that are more budget-type, could you let me know as well? Trying to organise a priority-queue in the cellar (inherited and aging rapidly).
And if there are keepers - ones that will age for a good while yet, feel free to inform me as well!


Recipe third dish:

* Ingredients
* 	* 1kg of free-range lamb mince
* 	* 5 cloves of garlic, crushed
* 	* 1 large brown onion, finely diced
* 	* 400g can of crushed tomatoes
* 	* 1/4 cup of tomato paste
* 	* 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
* 	* 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
* 	* 1 teaspoon of dried basil
* 	* 2 large eggplant, sliced lengthways in 1cm strips
* 	* 2 zucchini, sliced lengthways into 1/2cm strips
* 	* 1 large handful of fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped
* 	* 1 head of cauliflower, cut into florets, boiled, cooled.
* 	* 500ml of  Stock
* 	* Pinch of nutmeg
* 	* Sea salt and cracked black pepper
* 	* 2 tablespoons of grass-fed butter
* 	* 1 free range egg
* 	* 
* 
* Instructions
* 	1. Preaheat oven to 180 degrees.
* 	2. Brush the eggplant and zucchini with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and cracked pepper. Bake until just tender, but not falling apart or mushy.
* 	3. In a large saucepan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil and fry the onion and garlic until translucent. Add the cinnamon, tomato paste, oregano and basil and toss about for a few more minutes. Add the lamb mince and break up with a spoon. Brown the lamb, then pour over one cup of bone broth and the tin of tomatoes. Cover and allow to simmer on very low for about thirty minutes. Turn off the heat and stir through the parsley.
* 	4. Meanwhile, make the bechamel. In a high speed blender, combine the cauliflower, another cup of bone broth, butter, nutmeg and egg. Season with salt and pepper.
* 	5. In a large lasagne dish or cast iron skillet, layer the vegetables and lamb. We went eggplant ‚Äì lamb ‚Äì zucchini ‚Äì lamb ‚Äì bechamel ‚Äì  ‚Äì from bottom to top.
* 	6. Grill under a hot broiler until the cheese is golden and the bechamel bubbles ‚Äì about fifteen minutes.

I've never done anything like this. I have some ideas, but I'm curious what people on r/wine think is the best format for something like this? Forget about the competitive element and let me know what you think is a fun, fair way to pull this off based upon your experience with blind tastings.

&amp;#x200B;

The only real ""required"" element of the tasting, per the participants, is that at least one part has to be pitting an ""under $15"" bottle against an ""over $100"" bottle of the same varietal, appellation, and vintage. That seems straightforward to me, but I'm open to suggestions on that part as well.

6,Help a wine newbie out,"Around 2 years ago I had the opportunity to work for an extremely wealthy and very fancy bloke. Once a month he'd travel out to where I worked and all the employees would get really drunk. Like really drunk. I've always been a beer or whisky drinker, but he'd bring out some red wine and I'd have some with dinner and really enjoy it. Over the last two years I'd get a craving for it, buy a bottle and hate it, and not try wine again for a few more months.

So recently this happened again, except I really liked the wine. It's a Pinot Noir. I basically like it because it's pretty mild. Not too strong a flavour, or too bitter or too tannic or any of those other winey things. Sorta balanced. It's not as nice as I remember his wine to be, but I'm guessing his was a helluva lot more expanive than the $21 AUD I spent haha. 

I'm now onto my second bottle. I've noticed a few things. It tastes different. It's the same make and model. I'm guesing the fact that the first bottle was drank over 3 evenings makes a difference. For example, last night I could smell raspberry quite prominently whereas tonight I'm getting slightly different flavours and the raspberry is much less pronounced. Im also guessing it's raspberries. It smells like Raspberry Cordial I drank as a kid anyway.

I'm fine with that. It tastes and smells as good as yesterday, just a little different. So I'm guessing not only does wine have optimal temperature but also an age window. I'm just a little confused around all the terminology so I can't really just google it. Should I be leaving it open before drinking, finish it off within x-days? 

Any good resources to get a fairly good grounding in wine? I'd like to take a little bit of an academic slant to wine. It's interesting and I like to study new things. Both from a wine making perspective and also the agricultural side of things. I work within an agricultural field so am more interested in the wine making side of things. 

Also, I had a few glasses of a \*cheap\* Spumante called Diamond Nights. Really nice flavour but it's ridiculously sweet. Is all Spumante very sweet or are some brands less so? Any suggestions on what else to try? Brands of wine types?",wine,1564409786,tourdetactics,10,11,True,2019-07-29

If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components.

The first is a Chickpea Burger,  (Recipe: https://www.elephantasticvegan.com/vegan-falafel-burger-with-avocado-sauce-spinach-homemade-burger-buns/ but we'll only do the falafel patties and have yet to choose good side disher)

The second is a Ham Leek Arugula Frittata (Recipe: https://neighborfoodblog.com/2014/04/ham-and-leek-frittata-with-arugula.html)

The final one is a Mushroom Spinach Cauliflower Crust Calzone (Recipe: https://www.theironyou.com/2015/01/cheese-mushroom-and-spinach-cauliflower.html but we will do less cheese).  

What would you recommend? We have a fairly varied cellar (though some notable wines are lacking). It can be found here, if you are willing to have a look: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CAD5Fq9UwDhwlNaDrWKpokaECe4Y0y0-HvCLCwvRo8/edit?usp=sharing 
The reason I ask for your input is to learn better food/wine pairing from an experienced community!
Also, if there are wines that should be drunk sooner rather than later, please let me know.
Also, if there are wines that should be drunk sooner rather than later, please let me know.
Also, if there are wines that are more budget-type, could you let me know as well? Trying to organise a priority-queue in the cellar (inherited and aging rapidly).
And if there are keepers - ones that will age for a good while yet, feel free to inform me as well!


As example for the former, I think but am not sure the Chateau Lafleur de Haute-Serre 2006 Malbec is high overdue and should be drunk soon.
As an example of the second, the Baron de Charette Monopole Bourgogne Pinot Noir 2008  Chateau De Darcy is more of a budget wine?
As an example of the third, the Taurasi 2008 Feudi di Fan Gregoria Aglianico should stay for a while.",wine,1563991662,Kalenden,3,1,True,2019-07-24
8,[San Francisco] Wine Dojo Classes,"\&gt; This post might be more relevant to San Francisco/Bay Area residents.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently came across [Wine Dojo](https://sanfranciscowineschool.com/products/wine-dojo) organized by the San Francisco Wine School. It is basically a 90-minute blind tasting class conducted by MS David Glancy. I've been meaning to do this for a long time now because sitting back home on the weekends and doing the guesswork is probably a slow learning process. They seem to be relatively cheap with the $45 tag given that usually end up spending more if I choose wines at a wine bar myself. Plus, they happen every week which is great!

&amp;#x200B;

* Has anyone had a chance to attend these classes? How was your experience?
* Are they beginner friendly? (I am confident of Wine Theory 101 but tasting is something I still hope to get better at)

&amp;#x200B;

For context on why I ask - I'm planning to sit for WSET next year and really want to be fluent in my wine theory and tasting.",wine,1564003914,activatedgeek,0,2,True,2019-07-24
0,Any Wine professionals experience with the bulk/private label business and able to offer guidance on the industry?,"I have a family friend who sold wine through his own label for the last 20 years or so. He's interested in transitioning into either offering a private label service ‚Äì where he would provide the wine, bottling services, and shipping and the seller would take possession of the wine at the port of entry (meaning the buyer may have to have distributor's license). Or, possibly just selling via bulk contracts. He's coming up in years (approaching mid-80s) and I've volunteered to help him research the market.

Anyone with any inside knowledge of the industry know how competitive it is and if it's an endeavor possibly worth pursuing? Is going through a brokerage firm the only viable option?

3,Fives Roses: The historic Italian wine with an American connection,"In 1943, American General Charles Poletti was leading the reconstruction efforts in Southern Italy when came across an Italian rosato (ros√©) in the region of Puglia that he really liked. It is said that the Americans preferred the sweeter rosato flavor over the harsher Italian reds. Poletti wanted to purchase some bottles himself and his men. The owner of the winery, Piero Leone de Castris, was happy sell his families Cinque Rose di Negromaro to Poletti. However, he had one big problem. European industry was devastated by the war and there were no glass bottle available for the wine maker to purchase. To overcome the shortage, it was decided that beer bottles discarded by Americans soldiers would be reused for Leone de Castris‚Äô rosato. Piero chose to use the English translation ‚ÄúFive Roses‚Äù name on the label to appeal to his new American customers. It was the first bottled ros√© wine sold in Italy. Since then, Leone de Castris has become one of the largest wine produces in Puglia, eventually bringing DOC recognition to the remote Salice Salentino region. American beer bottles with the original 1943 labels can be found in the winery‚Äôs museum today. If you ever find yourself in Southern Italy, I highly recommend taking a trip to Cantina ""Leone De Castris"" for a tasting and museum tour. You won‚Äôt regret it.

William was born in 1929 and said goodbye this world only  two weeks ago. He established his, I would say, emblematic Chablis  domaine in 1959, and with only 7 hectares of family vines. Given the  ravages of frost, this was a hard time for Chablis, but a good time to  accumulate vineyard land, such that when William sold his domaine to the  Champagne house of Henriot in 1998, it had grown to 64 hectares,  including 15 hectares of grand cru. Today, still under Henriot, the  domaine now stands at 78 hectares plus the equivalent of many more from  purchased grapes

The F√®vres have, for hundreds of years, worked  the vines of Chablis, predominantly from their base in  Fontenay-Pr√®s-Chablis, and it remains a large, extended family,  including independent producers such as of Nathalie et Gilles F√®vre.

I understand the soil characteristics, elevation, avg temp and sun exposure of land has a huge impact on the quality of the fruit. However, I was wondering if places like Napa, Bordeaux or Burgundy are extremely special from a climate and terroir perspective which is why their wines are so good or if it is that those regions attract the top talent producers who know how to use the vines to make great fruit and wine. It is obviously a combination of both, but I am just wondering if the top producers from the aforementioned regions went to less prestigious places like Paso Robles or even Temecula, could they make wines that are as good as the Napa elites? 

Howell Mountain is rocky and volcanic and perfect for bold cabs but in general there are often Napa wineries next door to each other whose quality and wines style are totally different. I have to imagine the land difference is negligible in those cases so wine making has to be the difference.

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals. If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components. Apologies for the unusual kitchen

The first is a Chicken Yogurt Bake with Rosemary Parsnip Fries with Horseradish Yogurt Dipping
 (Recipes: http://myzucchinirecipes.com/baked-yogurt-chicken/ and  https://www.tujawellness.com/rosemary-parsnip-fries/ )

The second is a Feta Spinach Zucchini Shakshuka dish (Recipe: http://portandfin.com/italian-eggs-in-shakshukatory/)

The final one is a Potato Celeriac Pumpkin Veggie Burger on a Portobello Bun (in Dutch but Recipe: https://dagelijksekost.een.be/gerechten/groenteburgers-met-portobello ).  

What would you recommend? We have a fairly varied cellar (though some notable wines are lacking). It can be found here, if you are willing to have a look: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CAD5Fq9UwDhwlNaDrWKpokaECe4Y0y0-HvCLCwvRo8/edit?usp=sharing

Also, if there are wines that should be drunk sooner rather than later, please let me know.

0,Three great tasting experiences on a trip to Napa,"I just got back from a short trip to Napa and had three amazing tasting experiences so I thought I would briefly mention them.

&amp;#x200B;

I first visited Pride Mountain Winery, a place I have visited on several occasions in the past. Since I was alone I decided to do just their ""Estate Tasting"" and it was great.  I tasted the current vintages of their Viognier, Chardonnay, and Cabernet, as well as a couple of barrel samples of Cabernet from different vineyard blocks. The winery representative was knowledgeable and fun and the wines were great. We ended with a sip of their dessert wine sold just at the winery.  The winery grounds are beautiful and are up on Spring Mountain away from the traffic and crowds of the valley floor.

&amp;#x200B;

I had another fabulous experience at Stony Hill Winery (also on Spring Mountain and away from everything).  The winery representative was amazing and the tasting was outdoors in a beautiful and very peaceful setting. I honestly could have spent the entire afternoon lounging there, and they were in no hurry trying to get rid of us. I am a fan of unoaked Chardonnay, which this winery is famous for.  They also poured a Cabernet which honestly was just mediocre. However, they also poured some older library Chardonnays which really made the visit worthwhile.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I had a private tasting with another really great winery representative at Failla winery. I am a big fan of pinot noir and there aren't many opportunities to taste great pinots in Napa (the trip was for business and I didn't have time to get over to Sonoma). Failla always delivers.  They poured a number of great pinots, including older vintages, as well as a couple of outstanding Chardonnays.  They even opened an extra unoaked Chardonnay (aged in the cement egg that they use on occasion) for me to try. 

&amp;#x200B;

All three of these wineries provide relaxed, non-snobby yet very informative tasting experiences in gorgeous settings.  I was also lucky enough to have time for great dinners (with great wine, of course) at Auberge du Soleil and Bistro Jeanty, as well as Hess Winery (business-related). I highly recommend all of these activities on your next trip to the valley. I didn't have time to get to a few of my other favorites (Forman, Smith-Madrone, Cade, Cardonale, La Jota)  but there is always another trip on the horizon!",wine,1563229659,rooked153,3,7,True,2019-07-15

After I stopped cooking, I became a bar key manager and well as product manager. With that I've gained a serious understanding of beer and am continuing to study that. I've also been bumping up my whiskey knowledge.

Currently I'm working retail as a buyer and one of my reps tapped me on the shoulder for an opening they had.

One of these is Vinesse, an organization that has been making fascinating, boutique wines open over the States since 1993. In case you don't know where to begin with their wide choice of carefully assembled wines from little and little-known wineries, you can even join their wine club, and they will convey a choice of their wines ideal to your entryway. 

&amp;#x200B;

To kick you off with certain thoughts for the best wines to coordinate with your suppers, we've chosen five immaculate nourishment and wine pairings underneath. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wild Salmon and Orange Salad with Sauvignon Blanc 

&amp;#x200B;

salmon steak with serving of mixed greens 

&amp;#x200B;

Ordinarily, salmon works best matched with a more grounded tasting wine, similar to a Chardonnay, or even a Pinot Noir. The unpredictable, rich flavors coordinate the rich, greasy taste of salmon well. Be that as it may, for a light salmon dish, the new, citrus notes of a Sauvignon Blanc will work best. 

&amp;#x200B;

white wine and a container 

&amp;#x200B;

Sauvignon Blanc is a light, fruity wine ‚Äì fragrant, fresh and invigorating. Sauvignon Blanc functions admirably with servings of mixed greens and fish as its crisp taste does not totally overwhelm lighter flavors. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Wine](https://i.redd.it/if0ae8ootia31.jpg)

Attempt this formula from Vital Choice, an online wild fish and organics organization that represents considerable authority in high caliber, supportable sustenances to advance clients' wellbeing and prosperity. The orange and watercress serving of mixed greens is splendid and fresh, adjusting the greasiness of the salmon, and requiring a new, light wine. 

&amp;#x200B;

A fruity, fresh Sauvignon Blanc will coordinate this formula consummately. This Seacrest Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc from Vinesse conveys notes of lemon, apricot, squashed stone, papaya and lime. It draws out the fruitiness of the orange, and improve the fresh, crisp kinds of the watercress.",wine,1563219865,wildboar8,0,1,True,2019-07-15
13,Seeking advice- looking for a good bottle of red wine to keep and be aged for ~5 years.,"Hello! New to this sub so I‚Äôm sorry if this is not the right place to post. 

I‚Äôm looking for recommendations for a bottle of wine that will age well for 5 years. My fianc√© and I are doing a ‚Äúwine ceremony‚Äù at our wedding and will be locking a bottle of wine in a cool wooden box with the intention of not opening it until our 5th wedding anniversary. 

Wine does not usually last longer than a few weeks in my house so this is a new idea to me and I know some wines age well and other do not.

Now, I could ask you guys explicitly what vineyard to visit, but I believe that depends on so many things I would rather learn how to choose myself and ask:

How do you people choose what places to visit when you are in a wine area? Do you buy wines at the vineyard (then what if we dont visit a vineyard?) or do you go to a local wine shop or even just a supermarket?

8,"2013 Piedrasassi Sebastiano Syrah- Santa Ynez, California 2011 Carter Cellars 'Hossfeld Colisseum' Red Blend","In the midst of a 'dry July' until my gf and I head to Ireland for vacation. Not gonna lie I don't think I've gone a month without a drink since I hit legal drinking age...

That being said, I'm in wine sales so some times you gotta sample the goods to know what it is you're selling, and this was the perfect excuse to wet the whistle. Don't tell wifey tho!!!

Piedrasassi is made by Sashi Moorman of Evening Land &amp; Domaine de la Cote (Oregon and California respectively) and is made in a style reminiscent of Cornas (think Thierry Allemand)- partial whole cluster, native yeast ferment, large barrels, cool climate site, only a touch of sulphur at bottling, etc. 

If you have never had a Syrah in this style lemme tell ya, its the bees knees. Immediately after opening it showed the freshness of the whole cluster, but when I went back to it 30 minutes later it was all olive tapenade, bacon fat, garrigue, animal, leather, etc. Damn delicious juice. Really truly a beautiful expression of Syrah. 

The 2011 Carter Cellars is a bin-end and my boss and I decided to crack it for this sales call for fun. Really nice to see how this wine has evolved. 80% Merlot &amp; 20% Cab this baby shone right out of the gate for me. 2011 was a very mild vintage but that seemed to work perfectly for this merlot-dominant blend. Lots of freshness still, alongside tannins that were beautifully integrated and reminded of a bite into a high cacao % dark chocolate bar, enveloped by red and black fruit and a touch of spice. A great surprise and a really enjoyable wine.

My favorite wines are German Riesling and I really like the Gew√ºrztraminer I've had though it's harder to find. I went out and drank wine with a friend not too long ago and I tried his red Zinfandel after not having tasted any red wine in months, perhaps thinking I might have changed in that time. Not at all. My friend claimed it was delicious but it just smelled and tasted like what I imagine nail polish tastes like to me. It was just enormously bitter and bleh, I don't know how anyone can taste anything at all in that noxious concoction. They say some people are sensitive to tannins (which are of course a key feature of red wine but not present in white) so I wonder if I am one of those people and the tannins just drown out anything else. I also can't stand black coffee perhaps for the same reason. If not, is liking red wine just a matter of being an acquired taste?

2,Good wine suggestions for new drinker?,"Hi,

I turned 21 in march before and have been trying alcohol pretty sparingly since. I know kind of what I like, but want to expand my horizons. My local store (a Pete's Fresh Market) has a decent wine selection including an aisle of imported wines. I have a small to medium budget since I recently graduated (10-25? But I'd appreciate more expensive suggestions, for special occasions). 

So far, I have liked most of the moscatos I have tried, but the ones I had were just a bit too sweet and heavy for me. Very sweet things, I like the taste but they feel almost sickly sweet sometimes. I'd appreciate if someone knew one that was kinda light, fruity? Maybe citrusy?

I have liked the riesling I've bought at a restaurant and the barefoot riesling, since its still a bit sweet but less sugary tasting. Same with rose, I hated one, but really liked one that was a bit drier but still sweet. 

I've tried a cabernet once during college, I was not immediately opposed to it, and I sometimes like other things with tannins in it, like black coffee, if the flavor is pleasant. I had the capriccio sangria-- it was okay? not sure if I liked the aftertaste. 

I'm just looking for a couple suggestions for someone in my budget-- should I try buying different types of the barefoot wine, since I don't loathe them, just to see kinda what the difference is? Or are there other suggestions that are better and more specific?

I'm a bit lucky in that my boyfriend and I have slightly different wine tastes, at least where he's less picky than me, so if I hate it-- I can always shove it on him or my parents (lol).

Because you see I'm sitting here on the floor of my bathroom after just having puked up what amounts to two glasses of red wine (the wine was 19 crimes) and two cocktails of Malibu/pineapple juice. This is nowhere near the required amount of alcohol to normally get me to puke so I'm wondering if it's possible that something was off in the wine? I wasn't really paying attention to if it had any subtle difference in taste from when I first opened the wine but I at least don't think there'd been any major change, since I would suspect I'd have noticed it.

If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components.

The first is Bean Tomato Pizza (Recipe: http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251595/pizza-with-white-bean-puree-fresh-tomatoes/)

The second is a Lamb Filet with Cauliflower Roasted with Smoked Paprika and a Cumin Yogurt Sauce (Recipe: http://www.thisgirlsrecipes.com/smoky-paprika-roasted-cauliflower-with-garlic/ and sauce from https://omnivorescookbook.com/cumin-lamb-burger/)

As example for the former, I think but am not sure the Chateau Lafleur de Haute-Serre 2006 Malbec is high overdue and should be drunk soon.
As an example of the second, the Baron de Charette Monopole Bourgogne Pinot Noir 2008  Chateau De Darcy is more of a budget wine?

Where we live we can get d66 regularly for about $35, so something around that price point or a little lower would be ideal. However, for the sake of exploration and just an excuse to try more wines, I think up to 60 for a bottle would be fine.

When my parents moved house I bought them some Lanson Champagne, but for some reason they decided to gut and redo the house so they didn't open it. That was 5 years ago and now the house is coming to ""perfect finish"" spec so they will be opening it soon.

Unfortunatly though, they have stored it upright...in a cupboard in the kitchen. The kitchen has been through 5 summer heatwaves and 5 winters. They don't have a wine cooler - and would not get one in the new kitchen, choosing instead a wine ""rack"" that's open to air ie not even behind a cupboard anymore.

0,Review of Santa Ynez Valley and Paso Robles Trip (LONG),"WARNING: super long

About 3 months ago, I asked the wonderful people on this sub for advice regarding a trip to the Santa Ynez Valley and Paso Robles.  Thanks to all of the wonderful feedback, we had an absolutely wonderful time.  For anyone else who‚Äôs going to these places, here‚Äôs what I thought of our stops (in chronological order).

Even though the ratings I give to wine are very subjective (and not even as reliable for me when I‚Äôm just tasting a bit instead of experiencing a whole bottle), I‚Äôll reference some of my scores so you can at least see what I thought of the wines relative to one another.

Day 1 (Santa Ynez Valley): 

1.  Dragonette Cellars - Private Winery Tour and 6 wine flight:  This was absolutely wonderful and possibly the best all around experience of the trip.  This is in their winery (small warehouse), not the tasting room.  It was just our small group and our guide who was so knowledgeable, informative and passionate.  One of the owners also stopped by and spent a decent amount of time talking with us.  Again, so much passion was evident.  Such an intimate experience.  We learned a lot about where the wine comes from, how it‚Äôs made, why it‚Äôs made in those ways, etc. and our guide was always happy to answer all of our geeky questions.  We tasted 7 wines, which were all good to great (I even thought the Chardonnay and Pinot Noir were good to very good, and I‚Äôm usually not into those varietals).  

Wine Highlights: I thought their Fiddlestix PN was very good (88 pts) (and I normally don‚Äôt care much for PN).  My favorite was probably their MJM Syrah (91 pts), but their Grimm‚Äôs Bluff Sauvignon Blanc impressed me the most (90 pts with room for significant improvement in a few years).

We bought 3 bottles between the 2 couples and we signed up for their lowest tier membership.

Experience: Excellent
Wine: Very good
Cost: $25/person, reservation required; wine probably averages around $50/bottle or so
	
2. Sarloos and Sons ‚Äì General Admission Tasting + Cupcake Pairing:  We were warned about this place (i.e., lousy wine / tourist trap, but good cupcakes), and I warned the rest of my group beforehand, but the consensus was that we didn‚Äôt need every place to be stellar and it would be fine to have some good cupcakes and not feel the need to buy bottles.  We had low expectations going in to this place and they were met and nothing more.  Pretty great cupcakes, mediocre wine (mainly 80 ‚Äì 83 pts), staff that probably couldn‚Äôt care a whole lot less, no special ambiance.

We were glad that we stayed late at Dragonette and only spent about 30 ‚Äì 40 minutes here.  No one bought any bottles here.

Experience: Forgettable / below average
Wine: Mediocre 
Cost: $15/person + $11/person (cupcakes); wine happens to be very overpriced 

- sandwiches for lunch at Panino: good sandwiches and convenient. Would recommend for an efficient lunch spot.
	
3. Foxen ‚Äì GA Tasting at the bar: We were admittedly a bit too full after lunch and the cupcakes, whoops, but I don‚Äôt think that affects my opinion.  We were also running a tad behind and only had about 45 minutes to spend here.  We just walked-up to the bar, stood there, and went through two flights of tastings here (probably a total of 10 ‚Äì 14 wines total, but we split them).  There was a ton of Pinot here and, once again, that just really isn‚Äôt my thing, although I thought these wines were generally all good (84 ‚Äì 87 pts).  The winetender was fine, nice and seemed to know about the wines for the most part, but she wasn‚Äôt especially noteworthy.

No one bought bottles here (even though we had 15% off).

Experience: Average/solid
Wine: Good 
Cost: Don‚Äôt know as it was comped since the other couple are members; I think most of the wine is about $40 - $60

4. Foxen 7200 -- GA Tasting at the bar:  Similar to the main Foxen tasting room, but it‚Äôs outside and focuses on Bourdeaux and Cali-Italian varietals.  Again, our winetinder was pretty fine, but she didn‚Äôt know a ton about the wine (but she was new, and she was trying and nice).  Although, I was admittedly slightly drunk by this point and gave up on my notes half-way through the tasting, I liked the wine a bit better here and thought a few wines were very good (88 ‚Äì 89 pts).

Between the two couples, we bought two bottles (with 15% off).

Experience: Average/solid
Wine: Good
Cost: Don‚Äôt know as it was comped since the other couple are members; I think most of the wine is about $30 - $55

- dinner at Pico at the Los Alamos General Store: since this is a wine sub, I won‚Äôt go into detail about the meal, but the food was excellent (especially for the price), ambiance was nice, the service was solid, and the wine list is pretty great too.  I very highly recommend this restaurant and it‚Äôs a restaurant that I‚Äôd go back too even if it were in the city I live in that has tons of excellent food. 

Day 2 (Paso Robles):

5. Clos Solene - Private tasting (5 wines) w/ cheese pairing:  Another wonderful experience to start our day.  The grounds and room we tasted in were beautiful.  Our hostess was very friendly and knowledgeable about the wine, most of which is Rhone varietals (and a bit of Bordeaux).  The wine was very good to great, even though it wasn‚Äôt my most preferred style ‚Äì it was more elegant, refined and bit more old world in style, and I more often like new world / bolder wine the most.  Also, the pairings were EXCELLENT and I‚Äôd love to recreate them.

Wine Highlights: Everyone LOVED their Grenache-based dessert wine Sweet Clementine (92 ‚Äì 93 pts) and it paired miraculously with a French chocolate truffle.  I don‚Äôt normally like Rose much, but theirs was so elegant and refined that it pleasantly surprised me (87 pts), and they had and elegant and fairly complex Roussanne-based white blend that was very good and has some great potential (and my wife loved) (89 pts).

Between the two couples, we bought 5 bottles (4 of which were Sweet Clementine).  My wife wants us to become members and we are thinking about it.

Experience: Excellent
Wine: Very good / Great
Cost: $50/person, reservation required; wine is about $63 - $88/bottle or so

6. Epoch ‚Äì Basic tasting: Really nice tasting/room ambiance and good staff.  We were greeted outside with glasses of Rose and escorted to a reserved table / booth where our flight of wine was waiting for us with informational documents/booklets. Very comfortable. While the tasting wasn‚Äôt in a private room, we had our own area and it felt private enough.  The hostess was friendly and helpful, but would leave us to taste amongst ourselves and she‚Äôd check on us to see if we had questions or needed anything.  This was nice.  Other than the Rose and the White, their wines were great (we tasted a total of 7)! Generally, pretty big and bold new world Rhone-style wines, but still nicely refined and well balanced.  We had our driver pick up sandwiches for us while we were tasting and we ate outside under a lovely tree, looking over the fields/vineyard (they also has giant Jenga and cornhole outside).

Wine Highlights:  Great reds all around (all but one 90 ‚Äì 92 pts), but my favorite was the 2013 Tempranillo Reserva ‚Äì so BIG, viscous, layered, complex, and has plenty of stuffing to lay down for quite awhile.

Between the two couples, we bought 1 magnum and 2 other bottles.  They waived all 4 tasting fees with purchase of magnum of the Estate Blend.

Experience: Great
Wine: Great
Cost: $20/person (waived with purchase of bottle), reservation required; wine is about $60 - $75/bottle or so

- sandwiches for lunch from Mr. Pickles: solid and good price

7. Booker ‚Äì Walk-in tasting: We walked in a found a table to sit at. Atmosphere/building/furniture is nothing particularly special but not bad.  The server was friendly and helpful.  She served us 6 wines.  The wines are generally Paso Rhone style, but not quite as big as I was expecting.  For the most part, we were not tasting their top cuvees (e.g., Fracture).  I think since it was Sunday and slow, our hostess asked if we wanted to take a ride in the golf cart/truck and tour the vineyard.  We took her up on the offer and it was a lot of fun and beautiful.  Other than the Rose and White, which I thought were average, the wines ranged from very good to excellent (averaging about 90 or 91 pts).

Wine Highlights:  Everyone LOVED the upcoming vintage of My Favorite Neighbor (94 pts) and this was one of the very best wines of the trip.  Unfortunately, they wouldn‚Äôt sell us any unless we became members (and we really tried).

We thought it over, but left without any bottles.  We would have left with at least two My Favorite Neighbors if they were for sale.

Experience: Great (would‚Äôve been just ‚Äúgood‚Äù if no vineyard tour‚Äù)
Wine: Great
Cost: $30/person; wine is about $75/bottle or so

8. L‚ÄôAventure ‚Äì GA tasting at the bar:  This is one of the few Paso wineries that I was somewhat familiar with before our trip, and I‚Äôve loved the few wines of theirs that I‚Äôve had.  The grounds and room were nice, but we were not seated.  It was slow so we just about had our own winetender as we stood at the bar.   She was solid.  Since it was slow (I think), we were given a tour of the caves which was cool.  Out of all of our stops, I think L‚ÄôAventure had the best wines from start to finish.  The wines are big, bold, new world Rhone and Bordeaux/Rhone style. Other than the Rose (which was good for a Rose), their wines were all great to excellent (mainly 93 ‚Äì 95 pts).

Wine Highlights:  2016 Chloe (94 pts) and 2017 Inspiracion (94 ‚Äì 95 pts) were just excellent. Wonderful, smooth, luxurious mouthfeel; bold dark fruit flavor, balanced out beautifully with spices/baking spices. Pretty amazing lineup.

Between the 2 couples, we bought 2 bottles, but if we had more money, I‚Äôm sure we would‚Äôve been very happy buying just about one of each cuvee.

Experience: Great (would‚Äôve been just ‚Äúgood‚Äù if no cave tour‚Äù)
Wine: Great/Excellent
Cost: Don‚Äôt know as it was comped since the other couple are members, reservation required; wine is about $55 - $104/bottle or so

9. Herman Story ‚Äì GA walk-in tasting: very small, casual, and unassuming tasting room in downtown Paso Robles.  There were two friendly small dogs, so plus for that.  Winetenders were very friendly and quite knowledgeable.  They make HUGE red wines with a ton of big tannins and a good amount of acidity.  While I scored them all in the mid 80s, I liked pretty much all of them and don‚Äôt think they are made to drink upon release (or even within a few years therefrom).  I think these wines have stuffing to go the distance and I‚Äôm really interested to see how they evolve after several years.

Wine Highlights: I liked them all, but I think it‚Äôs hard to judge them too much without letting them lay down for several years.

Between the 2 couples, we (I) bought 2 bottles.  

Experience: Good 
Wine: Good
Cost: $20/person (waived with a purchase of 1 or 2 bottles [they originally said 2 bottles, but then waived both of fees with a bottle each]); wine is about $45 - 65/bottle or so

- dinner at Thomas Hill Organics: DO NOT GO HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.  I won‚Äôt go into it in detail, but there is something fundamentally wrong with this restaurant ‚Äì it‚Äôs broken.  What a sad experience.  This is the worst dining experience I‚Äôve had in several years.  We would‚Äôve been better off ordering Domino‚Äôs to our Air BnB (I‚Äôm not exaggerating, and I don‚Äôt think Domino‚Äôs makes good pizza).

Day 3 (Paso Robles):

10.  Tablas Creek ‚Äì Private collector‚Äôs vertical tasting: We had to come here not only because they make good wine, but of their historic significance.  They make all of the different Rhone varietals and release large variety of wine, generally in a more French style, and most of the wine is priced quite reasonably.  This is a large winery, but we were seated in our own private room with our own guide.  We tasted through side-by-side 6 vintages (2016 to 2010) of their flagship Esprit de Tablas.  This isn‚Äôt my favorite cuvee just because Mourv√®dre is my least favorite of the GSM varietals, but it really aged quite well and it was very cool to taste the different vintages side by side.  Except for the 2016, I thought these were all great (low 90s).  After the vertical, our guide said we could taste almost anything else on a list of about 15 ‚Äì 20 + wines, so we were able to taste a wide variety of wines (we tasted about 4 ‚Äì 5 more wines).  

Wine Highlights: Just comparing the different vintages was great.  The 3 oldest vintages expressed some great earthy notes, which I really enjoyed.  The surprise of the tasting and my favorite was a varietal I‚Äôd never had before ‚Äì Petit Manseng (92 ‚Äì 93 pts), which is approaching a dessert wine, but not quite that sweet/sticky.

Between the 2 couples, we bought 2 bottles and we also joined their very low commitment membership to get a bit of a discount on everything.

Experience: Great/Excellent
Wine: Great
Cost: $40/person, reservation required; wine is about $25 - 85/bottle or so, probably averaging around $50/bottle or less

- lunch at Opolo winery: this was very convenient as it‚Äôs right next to Torrin and not far from Tablas Creek.  Good ambiance.  We got a decent pizza (big enough for 2) and a glass of wine for $22.

11. Torrin ‚Äì Private tasting: Wonderful experience from top to bottom. The building, d√©cor, furniture, lighting, general ambiance and vibe are excellent.  We‚Äôre the only visitors in this medium-sized building, all seated at a great big wooden table and nice leather chairs.  The staff is wonderful -- friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  Other than with respect to Dragonette, we felt the most passion from these employees.  But, the wine ‚Äì wow! Every wine was great.  While I think L‚ÄôAventure had some better wines and Booker had a better wine, I was so impressed that Torrin made two varietals that I normally don‚Äôt care for (Chard and Pinot) and I LOVED them (90 ‚Äì 92 pts).  This gives me a lot of confidence in whatever they‚Äôll come out with.  The Rhone style blends were also great (although, there wasn‚Äôt any Akasha to taste) (92 ‚Äì 93 pts, and with wonderful aging potential).  The Lagom wines (Chard, Pinot) were flavorful, but extremely well-balanced and not overdone.  The Torrin proper wines were big, bold and full, but still well balanced and not over done.

Wine Highlights: VERY impressive Chard and Pinots and I loved the Banshee (93 pts), a syrah forward GSM blend that was pleasantly savory and herbal, in contrast to a lot of very fruity and spicy GSMs I have.  I can‚Äôt wait to see how the Banshee ages.

Between the 2 couples, we bought 4 bottles (and would‚Äôve bought more, budget permitting); and we each became members.

Experience: Excellent
Wine: Great/Excellent
Cost: $30/person, reservation required; wine is about $62 ‚Äì 8$5/bottle or so

3,Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for two separate dishes: Chicken Artichoke Lasagna and a Lentil Spinach Curry (with Paneer added),"For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals. If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components.



The first is a Chicken Artichoke Lasagna (Recipe: not online but but with chicken, pasta sauce, pepper, some parmesan cheese, artichokes and basil )

The second is a Lentil Spinach Curry with Paneer added (Recipe: http://www.berrysweetlife.com/mushroom-broccoli-ginger-stir-fry/ )

Also, if there are wines that should be drunk sooner rather than later, please let me know.

Each was stunning and remarkable in their own right, but the star of the show had to be the ‚Äò85 Montelena. Still so fresh, bright, and vibrant as well as some well integrated flavors and approachability that could only come with age.

4,Changing to a career in wine... looking for some advice.,"Hi r/wine,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to finish a BEng (Hons) Aerospace, but I'm considering changing my career trajectory to viticulture and winemaking.

&amp;#x200B;

Some backstory:

I have about 10 years experience working in hospitality, 5 was as a barista, and 5 was in bartending, restaurants, and fine-dining, this is where I originally got a bit of an education and appreciation for wine.

Fast forward a few years and I'm coming to the tail-end of my degree and I'm doing an internship in Germany, working in R&amp;D in an office for a blue-chip manufacturing company. I'm really hating working in an office, sitting at a computer all day and not doing anything with my hands except type lines of code, and so I start entertaining the possibility that a future at a desk might not be what I'm suited to.

Because my partner and I are from Australia, we take full advantage of being in Europe and do ***a heap*** of travelling. It's during this period of travelling around Europe that I found a deeper love for wines and a really strong desire to be involved.

I started reading a lot about viticulture and permaculture, and learned all about the Phylloxera outbreak in Europe, and how Australia has some of the original lineage of ungrafted Grenache vines. My partner and I even rode our bikes through Portugal just to get a couple of bottles of Ramisco from Adega Viuva Gomes in Colares!   


Now I'm thinking about trying to get some cellar hand work once I finish my degree and I'm not exactly sure where to start... I'm a really hard worker, I love working with my hands, but I'm a bit worried that my age (29) will make it harder to find a job without prior experience. 

I've read about WSET courses, but apart from these I'm not sure what my best ""in"" would be, I want to get onto the next vintage which I guess would be starting around February in Australia.

I'm hoping to get some advice or pointers on where I should start, or how I can get a cellar hand job. Would my previous experience in hospitality or my Eng degree be helpful?

Any success stories of other people getting into winemaking after a career change would be motivating too!

I've talked with the awesome folks over at KB and they provided feedback and recommendations on opening order and such.

I asked a question about coravins a while back (it's on the way!) and you all gave me wonderful responses, so I thought I'd ask this as well:

On a whim, I decided to look up how much $ a bottle of first-growth Bordeaux would set me back by. I knew it'd be 1k+, and at first what I found seemed to match. Taking Chateau Haut-Brion as an example:

[2005 - $1150](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=1&amp;search=13727&amp;searchtype=Contains) 
or

[2009 - $1190](https://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=1&amp;search=18310&amp;searchtype=Contains)

But if I go and look up some older vintages, I get prices in the $400-500 range even.
[1990 - ~$500?](https://www.klwines.com/Auction/Bidding/AuctionBidDetail.aspx?sku=1424334)
Also saw a 1999 for around $380? at a wine shop, though I'm not 100% sure on that. 

I realize that certain vintages might be better than others, but does it really command such a difference? Would it be a bad idea to go for the ""worse"" vintages to have a sort of cheap option at trying a 1st growth? Is 1999, for example, such a bad vintage?

And winebid has even cheaper -  I'm guessing that risk of a bad bottle is  what's causing the discount? But doesn't winebid pre-screen the bottles beforehand for provenance and whatnot?

Was wondering if someone could explain this. And yes, I know that being classified as a first growth does not give it some magical powers, etc, but it was something interesting that caught my eye and wanted to learn about.",wine,1562104030,Felixiium,15,11,True,2019-07-02

Welcome to the July challenge selection post!  Happy Canada day to my fellow Canadians, and Happy Indepedence Day to those readers who are checking in from the States!  Last months challenge seemed pretty populer, despite me thinking that Bordeaux is an ideal BBQ wine.  Oops!  Oh well, live and learn.  I also had a request last month for something a little more summer friendly, and so this month I think I have the ideal challenge.

\*\*Variety/Varietal: Chardonnay\*\*

The I4C is held each July in the Niagara region to celebrate Chardonnay, more specifically, chardonnay made from grapes grown in cool climate regions.  More information can be found on the [I4C About Us](https://www.coolchardonnay.org/about-us/) Page.  So, I invite everyone to grab their favourite Chilean or NZ or Canadian Chardonnay and join us!

So, just like with past MWC entries, on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.).

8,What do you guys think about Maison Mommessin as a cru Beaujolais producer? How does it compare to other Cru Beaujolais producers?,"All I know is that it's way cheaper than other cru Beaujolais in my region, like half the price. I kinda enjoy cru Beaujolais. But I've never had anything other than Mommessin because I'm on a budget, so I'm wondering how it compares to other more expensive producers that I can't afford right now, but hope to afford someday, like Lapierre. 

By the way, have in mind that high taxes and high margins (from low competition) in my country make everything like double the price for me, so Lapierre (which I've heard is like benchmark for Morgon) would cost me around $60 (so... Not cheap for someone on a budget, though I could gift myself that on special occasions, therefore why I'm posting this.)

But is Mommessin a good Beaujolais producer? Or is it just acceptable? I mean, I like it. I've had their Domaine de Lathevalle Morgon and Domaine de la Presle Fleurie (both around $20 in the overpriced stores around me), and they were quite enjoyable.

I'm curious as to whether anyone here has spent any time on wine tourism in Argentina, especially Uco and Cafayate? My Spanish isn't particularly advanced, so I'm also wondering if vineyards generally have an English speaker? 

I'd prefer to stay away from the really big producers. I also have a very soft spot for Torront√©s, which is why I'd like to venture up to Cafayate. I'd also love to hear about vineyards with good restaurant options. Of course, happy to pay a little more for tastings.

3,Help selecting anniversary bottles!," I got married last year and have decided I want to open a different 2018 vintage bottle for every anniversary until death do us part. We celebrated our 1 year anniversary a couple weekends ago with a 2018 Cloudy Bay Sauv Blanc (which was fantastic--subtle; nuanced minerality with juicy pome fruit and restrained citrus. Much different from some other NZ grapefruit bombs I have had in the past.)

After that, I am a bit lost/out of my league. I know basics of varietals, regions, some appellations, however I am a beer nut at heart and could use some guidance on wine. If any one has the depth of recommendations to suggestion producer/appellation/variety specific bottles for each anniversary, that would be incredible, however I was just hoping for a few suggestions based on the range of years.

For example:

Anniversaries 1-5: NZ Sauv Blanc, German Reisling, etc.

Anniversaries 5-10: Oregon or French Pinot Noir, etc

So on and so forth...

I understand not all 2018 wines are out yet, but looking more for aging recommendations, what holds up best over time and which wines have the best pedigree (as I will be purchasing most of these in the next few years without tasting). My only stipulations are that bottles must be 2018 vintage and be sub-$200 unless it is a major anniversary like 25 or 50.

I do generally enjoy dry Rieslings / trockens, but I don't see how these GGs are worth the premium, unless the GGs really pull ahead with some age.

Relative to Rieslings with some RS, do you think GGs generally require more age to be fully enjoyed?  Will the GGs ripen / get a fuller flavor after 10+ years, or do they remain very lean by design?

This is the best community I've found to offer advice on wine trips. My future wife and I are planning to take a 14-16 day honeymoon trip around northern Italy - and I'd love to include as many visits to wine producers as possible! We've both visited Italy before and have seen the major sights so we'd like to dig into some places that we haven't been like Piedmont/Lake Como/Dolomites. The following itinerary might be a bit ambitious for our timeframe, and we may cut something out so we don't feel like we're constantly on the move. The Dolomites are a late addition but they seem so worth to visit. We were originally planning to spend most of our time in Piedmont.

Basic Tentative Itinerary - Trip around end of September through first part of October.

Day 1-2 Fly into Venice or Milan/rest for a night - If we want to head towards the Dolomites and stop by Valipocella, which city do you think is best to fly into?

Day 3 Drive to Verano/Negrar - visit Quintarelli Giuseppe + another Amarone producer. Spend a night somewhere around Negrar or head straight to Bolzano.

Day 4-7 Drive north to Bolzano or one of the smaller villages in the Dolomites (still researching this part of the trip). Hike/visit different places in Dolomites (would love any suggestions here too)

Day 7-9 Drop off car/train to Milan/train up to Lake Como/Ferry to Bellagio - Stay a night or two in Bellagio

Day 9 Train to Turin - Spend 1 night in Turin

Day 10-14 - Drive to Alba - Visit producers around Barolo/Barbaresco/Asti/Alba - would love any suggestions here. Maybe stay in La Morra as I've seen suggested here as well.

Day 15 or 16 - Train to Turin. Fly home.


It seems like it's best to have a car to drive around the Dolomites and the Piedmont region to visit wineries. Hoping to get by without one in the other places - not sure how great public transportation.

I practically fell in love with its flavor. I mean it didn't even taste like wine it was like drinking sparkling grape juice. But the issue is the winery makes you pay 25 dollars for a 750ml bottle, which is steep. 

I can't find any other wines similiar to it. I also can't find any where that sells it other then that winery.

4,"""Smart"" Thermometer Recommendations (Wine Fridge Temperature)","Hi Everyone,  

  

I recently picked up a 180+ bottle wine fridge from a craigslist listing and while it works as prescribed, I tend to be a realist and can't help but think of a terrible scenario where it stops working and my wine gets cooked.  We have the fridge in the garage at the moment, due to it's size, and the temp in there can fluctuate rather extremely at times (Location: Santa Rosa, CA).  Maybe it would be best to put it somewhere in doors to be on the safe side...  Besides that, I think a safe guard would be to purchase a ""smart"" thermometer that I can check via iOS and/or be alerted if there are any issues with the temperature.  Does anyone have any recommendations for a thermometer that does this sort of thing?

5,Understanding VDP and quality German wine,"Getting into German riesling and I have to ask, is it reasonable to assume that the vast majority of VDP wine (even at the gutswein level) is relatively high-quality wine? The VDP labeling protocol resembles the Burgundy model, except with the caveat that the VDP is close-knit association of the 200 or so top producers, whereas the Burgundy model allows anyone in given that the wine itself fits the criteria for whichever appellation it falls under.

Put another way, a gutswein is more likely to be high-quality than a bourgogne blanc or rouge, correct? The former is guaranteed to come from a high-quality producer while a bourgogne blanc or rouge could just come from an obscure and mediocre producer. 

Just bought a VDP Von Winning Gutswein trocken Riesling and it's opening my eyes. Thought it was one of the better rieslings I've had and yet it's simply the most basic level of the VDP tiers.",wine,1561398888,ucforange,17,9,True,2019-06-24

My favorites from the trip were the '15 Turnbull Black Label and the '15 Caymus Special Selection (I've read that Caymus is pretty controversial on this sub, but I can't complain).  The other Turnbull offerings (CS Oakville, Pierra), Caymus CS, and Dark Matter CS were all excellent, although I fear some of the subtlety of those wines might have been lost on me at this point.

Suffice to say, I enjoy big Napa cabs, but it's all I've known at this point. What are some good styles or regions to branch out to from there? Would there be any good wine memberships to sign up for at this point? My uncle recommended Turley as an inexpensive subscription, but I'd hesitate to have wine shipped to me during a Texas summer.",wine,1560843527,EpilepticPudding,25,1,True,2019-06-18

Passed it, so I could sign up for a level 3 class in September.  My understanding is that the books will be shipped to me over the next days for me to go prepared to the class. It's going to be an interesting read as my knowledge for Italy is pretty deep (I have a diploma with the Italian Sommelier Association, AIS) as opposed to the rest of the world, where I believe I could claim basic/medium knowledge. 

My goal is to improve my ability to taste and talk about wine in English (I will take the course and exam in English) and get better on wine in the world.

I've already reviewed multiple threads on WSET3 with plenty of hints, but bother to drop yet another post on it just to make sure I am not missing any basic and must-know resources.

For myself, it doesn‚Äôt really matter, I‚Äôm down for anything but my boyfriend, that‚Äôs a different situation haha.

My fiance and I are getting married in early September and are having a relatively small wedding - ~50 people. We are going on a Napa wine tour next weekend and would love to pick up some bottles of wine while we are there and save them for the wedding, but are worried about storage. So I have two questions! 

1) We don't have a wine cooler or anything of the sorts. Will the wine spoil in that amount of time? Is it even worth trying to save nice wine for this time?

2) If we do attempt to get wine for our wedding while in Napa, how should we store it in our house so that it is least likely to go bad?

Sorry for my lack of knowledge here. I LOVE wine but am definitely not super knowledgeable about it, but I wish I could treat my wedding guests to something good.

Also I forgot to add, the circumstances around the wedding prevent us from ordering wine, so it's either Napa wine we pick up on the trip, or whatever cheapo wine we can get in our backcountry grocery store.",wine,1560694278,wyominglove,5,6,True,2019-06-16

I will be there with my dad and brother in August, and we have one day set aside in each area of wine tasting/exploration. 

In South Tyrol, before we head into the mountains to hike, we will have one full day and a car to head out from Bozen/Bolzano and go anywhere. A few places I have on a list to try and pick from are: Cantina Terlano, Tiefenbrunner Schlosskellerei, Manincor, Muri-Greis, Cantina Colterenzio, and the Caldera/Kalterer See area. Gewurtz/Pinot Blanc/Riesling are some of my favorites, but I'm excited to try other local varietals like Lagrein. Are there any must try places?

In Verona, we will be staying north west of the city, inland from Lake Garda, and will be right in the heart of the area between Valpolicella Classica and Bardolino DOCG. My dad loves Amarone, so I want to try to hit at least one solid producer for him. This wine region is totally new to me, and any recommendations would be incredibly helpful!

3,Event costing/finances,"So i'm struggling to figure out my break even point for a wine event my company is doing and none of my colleagues i've asked so far have been able to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically we want to do a tasting event where we charge $20 for a tasting and then figure out what the minimum spend on wine should be before they can get a rebate on the tasting fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

The tricky thing is we have 10 wines across varying price points from $40 all the way to $280. Our average bottle price is $55 and the average margin about 17%. The cost of running the event is about $28 a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are charging less than the actual cost because there's a psychological barrier we've found where people won't want to pay more than $20 unless there's some really high kit stuff in the line up. 

&amp;#x200B;

So please let me know if i am way off but here's the scenario -  our minimum spend for the $20 tasting fee rebate is $200. So if a customer spends $200 the cost of goods on these wines being bought are $166 (base on my 17% margin). If i refund the $20 for meeting that minimum spend that means I'm only getting $180 and making $14. However because the actual tasting cost itself is $28 that means i need minus off another $8 from this profit totaling $6.

5,Coravin - worth it? Does it live up to expectations? Which model?,"So I've been thinking about splurging on a coravin for a while. I currently use private preserve spray to keep bottles that I've opened but don't finish, but it only seems to last up to a week or so. 

I usually am the only one drinking wine, so it'd be nice to be able to say, pour a glass each from two different bottles and compare them, and not worry about having to finish two bottles alone in a week. Or enjoy a good bottle over a good period of time, instead of having to try to finish it in 1-2 nights.

Does the coravin live up to the hype? I'd assume it's not as good as they advertise in that bottles don't last ""forever"" - how well does it work for preserving bottles? How many ""uses"" /punctures can I get out of each bottle before the cork gives away? How about older vintages? And how cost-efficient is it compared to something like private preserve (how many uses per cartridge)?

Also I see a bunch of different models on Amazon - any recommendations for one, price:performance wise?

I was really impressed with it the first few times I tried it, but didn't like the bottle I opened last night nearly as much. It had a distinct tartness to it, almost akin to a granny smith apple. There were also other, more difficult to articulate elements of greenness to it as well. The factors I did enjoy about it the first time- supple fruit, dusty texture to balance the acidity, hints of baking spices- were all either diminished or non existent. 

The bottle didn't exhibit any of the typical indicators of a bad bottle that I'm accustomed to- wet newspaper, sulphur, etc. It also didn't have an oxidized sherry-like character to it either.

0,Anyone use Alexa to track wine inventory?,"A while back, I was talking with a friend, sharing stories about how we wanted to keep track of what wines we have, but it's just so hard to keep up with it.

Getting caught up feels so overwhelming, especially if you forgot what you drank!

So I wondered, if I could do it by voice, maybe it'd be easier, and I'd be more likely to keep up with it. Seemed to make sense to me. But I couldn't find any Alexa skills to just let me add bottles to my inventory, remove them, and know what I have.

![img](z1gnot24w4431)

The **Domaine Trapet Gevrey-Chambertin 1er Cru 2014** is a blend of premiers crus sites En Ergot, Combottes, Petite Chapelle and Clos Prieur.  The Domaine has been practicing biodynamic since 1996, and has been certified since 2009.  Trapet is one of the best-known proponents of stem inclusion in Gevrey, and their grands crus see 50-60%, premiers crus see 30-50%, and village wines usually see around 25%, though all of this ranges according to the vintage.  The Domaine is also conservative in its use of new oak, with 20-25% on village wines, 30-40% on premiers crus, and 50-60% on grands crus. 

This wine was very tight and was obviously too young, but a purity of red fruit and pure aromatics made this wine the most viscerally pleasurable out of the four tasted.  I found it pure, long, unmistakably Gevrey in its structure, *c√¥t√© sauvage*, and depth, even if the wine retained a certain balancing elegance and finesse from its whole-cluster vinification.  

The **Chandon de Briailles Pernand-Vergelesses 1er Cru Ile des Vergelesses 2011** comes from the best vineyard in Pernand other than the En Charlemagne across the valley. Many have argued that this site should be promoted to grand cru, and the site has been highly rated in previous Burgundy classifications.  At Chandon de Briailles, the vineyard management has been fully biodynamic since 2005 and organic since 1998, with organic practices going back to 1980. This wine comes from vines planted mid-slope facing east, in limestone-clay soils rich in iron. Average vine age is 42 years.  Since 2011, the Domaine has cut back on stems, particularly in its village wines, but many of their premiers and grands crus still see nearly 100% whole-cluster vinification.

This wine showed the stems the most out of these four, with a certain textural influence especially notable in the midpalate.  Spicy, light in color, with red fruit accompanied by a flavor approaching that of black tea, this is quite a different wine, for example, than Domaine Rollin's destemmed Ile des Vergelesses, which is more black fruited and brooding.  Still, this wine obviously has a long life ahead of it, as it still packs plenty of fruit and is waiting for the oak and the stems to integrate.  

The **Domaine de Montille Beaune 1erCru Les Gr√®ves 2010** was an emotional experience for me.  I adore the wines of Hubert de Montille, and have had the privilege of having many of his efforts from the 1970‚Äôs-1990‚Äôs.  Hubert‚Äôs wines were stern, with no virtually no chaptalization, and sometimes took decades to come into their own.  √âtienne has tried to remain true to his father‚Äôs style, but many feels that the wines are more approachable in their youth today than from vintages in the 20thcentury.  Viticulture at the Domaine has been certified organic since 1995, and today I believe that there are some biodynamic practices as well.  De Montille tends to pick early, and his wines in the cellar also finish their malos fairly quickly, which is how things played out in 2010 as well. I‚Äôm more familiar with the Domaine‚Äôs wines from Les Taillepieds, Les Mitans, Les Rugiens, and En Champans, and had never had any of their wines from Beaune.  

I found the 2010 Les Gr√®ves very expressive, with red fruits, flowers, and anise on the nose and palate.  There was, unsurprisingly at this Domaine, a mineral backbone that carried the wine from start to finish.  Stem inclusion here has increased since √âtienne took over, most wines see 20-50% whole bunch, depending on the site and vintage, and wines usually see about 30% new wood.  

The **Sylvain Morey Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru Champs Gains 2015** closed our tasting (I still hadn‚Äôt opened it when I took this photo).  Chassagne Rouge is almost forgotten today, and that‚Äôs a shame.  In the 19thcentury, there was little white produced from the village outside of the Motnrachet climats, and what little white there was was usually Pinot Blanc or Pinot Beurot (Pinot Gris)!  Anyway, this genre of Burgundy, which, when faithfully executed, is just as worthwhile as wines from Volnay or Nuits, is at risk of disappearing entirely from the public consciousness.  Sylvain Morey inherited his Domaine from his father, Jean-Marc, who split his Domaine between his children in 2014.  Sylvain has made his mark on the style of vinification since taking over.  Like under his father, all fermentations are spontaneous.  In contrast to Jean-Marc, however, Sylvain practices 35-50% whole-cluster fermentation for his red wines, although some wines, like his Gamay-dominated Coteaux Bourguignons, are completely destemmed.  The *cuvaison* is quite long at the Domaine as well, usually about 25 days.  During *√©levage*, use of new oak is  quite measured, with most red wines seeing approximately 25% new wood.  Finally, after sixteen months in barrel, wines red and white are fined with Casein but are not filtered prior to bottling.  The Domaine sells three red wines, a village-level Chassagne-Montrachet Rouge, a Chassagne-Montrachet Rouge 1er Cru Champs Gains, and a Santenay 1er Cru Grand Clos Rousseau.

The nature of 2015 showed on this wine in my opinion.  It was the highest in alcohol, and seemed to be a bit hot on the palate.  This wine also had the most material, and was in a very awkward stage compared to the Trapet 2014 or the De Montille Les Gr√®ves.  Nevertheless, the wine was precise and elegant, and will age very well, I just feel that its sepereate components need more time to integrate.

Of course there are many other Domaines known for including their stems, and I would have loved to include efforts from **Dugat-Py**, **Dujac**, the **Clos des Lambrays**,**Roumier**, **Domaine de la Roman√©e Conti**, **Bizot**, **Leroy**,**Domaine de l‚ÄôArlot**, and **Prieur√©-Roch**in this tasting.

I quit my finance internship in Febeurary of 2018 due to illeness and when I was ready to get back  on my feet I found a job at a wine store and immediately fell inlove. The past year has been great and I have even started studying for my CSW and hope to become a certified SOMM soon. What scares me is that there seems to be alot risk working in wine. Lack of benefits, no or little PTO, pay is less than most industries even with advanced certs etc. I am married (I know I am young) and my wife wants kids in 2-3 years and I don't know if a job in the wine industry will cut (I DO NOT want to get into distribution lol) .

I currently work in a tasting room at Coopers hawk and I really enjoy it but I feel like it's not going to cut it and I am scared.

11,Winestyr Review,"Hey /r/wine! I recently visited the Winestyr tasting room in Chicago. They are a wine club delivery service that specializes in smaller, hard to find American wines that has tasting locations in Chicago.

I was invited by a friend who organized a consultation for 4 of my wine loving friends. I went in skeptical because many of the wines on their website have little info and trendy labels. The space is nice and quaint and they served us 6 of their currently featured wines with a cheese board. They were generous with the pours and it overall lasted about 2 hours. They had a few smaller producers I had heard of or tasted before like Teutonic wine company and Domaine de la Cote. One of our group is a wine professional and the rest of us are just wine lovers, but we generally liked the wines and the experience. They weren‚Äôt very pushy about signing up for the wine club although one person did buy a bottle to be shipped.

If you live in Chicago I think it‚Äôs worth doing the consultation which is believe is free. Can‚Äôt argue with free wine in a cool space for a couple hours. Our general consensus was that we couldn‚Äôt justify signing up for a wine club that ships random bottles, but it would be good for someone wants who wants have cool wines on hand that doesn‚Äôt really know a lot about wine.",wine,1560452212,elmilagro,0,1,True,2019-06-13

I really like CdB Pinot Noir and especially from around Corton. I had read the only review for this particular producer on Cellar Tracker before purchasing - but I inclined to disregard it as the reviewer had tasted the wine on a Singapore Airlines flight, and it was the only one.    


I opened the bottle last night after putting it in the fridge briefly to get it down to around 60F so it would have a chance to warm up a little bit to let it get some oxygen for an hour or so as is usually suggested. After the first hour I tasted it and it was pretty much exactly as the Cellar Tracker reviewer described - super thin, a tiny hint of cherry/raspberry and some lactic notes, some slatey notes but not very much body at all, and some alcohol coming through with a very short finish. I let it alone for another hour and tasted again, and really no improvement at all. I even tried running it through my Vinturi to get it to breathe but it didn't make much of a difference, still very closed.   


I'll try tasting it again tomorrow - I know sometimes these wines aren't very expressive when they're young, but often in CdB they can be so, so I am surprised this one is so muted and flat. Is it just that it was opened too early or is it really just a dud?

My question is, when a red wine says it has notes and flavour of cherries or a white wine with apricots, does that mean those fruits have been used as an ingredient in the wine making process? or it just somehow tastes and smells similar? As this would mean we wouldn't be able to try those.

Possibly some new recommendations are to be had for a wine fridge that can handle odd sized bottles. So much of the research has people claiming Bordeaux won't fit, that the capacity as stated is always over and above what they really hold, and that even Eurocave have shelving systems that are both precarious for the wine, and inefficient for grabbing a bottle, etc.  I've got magnum and jeroboam, etc. and some weird champagne and other bottles.  I also don't have a proper area for it, but was using my closet as a passive cellar that holds about 200 bottles, but this recent heat wave notched up the temp high enough I am done taking risks.

&amp;#x200B;

The space could fit a fridge, but I assume a compressor would heat up the cold closet and work itself towards failure quicker than not, but would that mean you get a ""built in"" model, as it will be out of sight, and those are built for more confined spaces with less ideal venting / air exchange?

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, if space is at a premium to be able to fit a fridge into a tight space that wouldn't function perfectly, and knowing a thermoelectric probably couldn't get a solid and constant low 50s for 100+ bottles, would an off site storage be a better bet?

Harmonic mix of cherries, cranberries and pomegranate on the nose. Floral tones, with black pepper joins the fray after some aeration. Appealing ""meaty"" fruit which fills the mouth nicely. Long and dry finish. 91p.

2013 Vivier Sun Chase Sonoma Coast - ""Blue"" nose in the start which blows away and turns into a classic Pinot-nose of raspberries, pomegranate and flowers. Fresh and with more body than expected. Dry exit. Extremely longlasting, delicious aftertaste that gives associations to the aromas. 92p.

2010 Domaine Jamet C√¥te-R√¥tie - ose is about as good as Syrah can get. Deep dark perfume. Freshly milled pepper, blackberries, blackcurrant, flowers, fenal√•r. Layer upon layer, but balanced and tethered. Clean and harmonious in the mouth as well. Fresh and relatively quaffable with pleasing tannins. There's good depth in the fruit, and it's long. 94p.

2018 Julian Haart Piesporter Goldtr√∂pfchen Riesling Kabinett - Nose is a bit shy, but pleasant with green apples, lime, pear and flowers. Clean, fresh and delicious mouthfeel with a delicate sweetness. There is depth here, but without any heaviness at all. Very good kabinett! 91p

2017 Sadie Family Treinspoor - Pure aromas of cherries, red apples and flowers. Medium weight. Juicy fruit, nice acidity and fine tannins all in harmony. A well made wine. 91p

2016 Lu√≠s Seabra Vinhos Douro Xisto Cru Branco - This was a treat! Slightly restrained yet delicate nose of apples, beeswax and flint. Fresh, concentrated fruit with minerals. Balanced, with an interesting progression in the mouth. Grapefruity-finish. 92.

2011 Pietro Cassina Coste della Sesia Ciuet - Appealing aromas of strawberry, coffee and leather. Balanced oak. The taste matches the smell. Wonderful thirst-quenching fruit, with good acidity and refined tannins that binds it all together brilliantly. 90p.

2017 Craven Clairette Blanche - Nose of flowers, green apples and beeswax. Lies there calm and collected. Lean and fresh. A bit hollow in the middle, but with a long dry ending. Apparently the last vintage of this wine ever, which is a shame. Only 11% alcohol. 88p.

2017 Thorne &amp; Daughters S√©millon Tin Soldier - Smells of apricot, flowers and marzipan. Slightly herbacious too. Rich fruit feel, with high viscosity. Gentle and balanced acidity. Tastes almost as good as it looks. 90p.

2015 - Johan Vineyard Drueskall Pinot Gris - Getting floral associations on the nose, with nuts, and a mix of strawberry compot and [BonBon S√∏ppeldynga](https://cdn.partykungen.se/img/products/1300/bonbon-soptipp-1.jpg). Juicy and rich fruit. Balanced acidity. Delicate and long salinic finish, with light tannins. This is a very interesting orange wine. 91p.

Overall thoughts: 
* Luis Seabra makes the most exciting wines in Portugal. His Xisto Cru white is one of the best white wines I've had in recent times. I ordered 3 more after I last tasted it.
* Jamet never fails to deliver. 
* The South-African wine scene is filled with talented winemakers. 
* I had Orange wine-fatigue for a while, but these two (Thorne &amp; Daughters and Johan Vineyards) was a breath of fresh air.
* For great and affordable Rieslings in Mosel, Julian Haart is the way to go.
* The Vivier wine is the third I've tried from him. His Sonoma Coast is the best value, Crown's Gap is the most Burgundy-like, and this one (Sun Chase) is the most ""serious"" one. Deserved a good meal.
* Pietro Cassina is a great winemaker in Lessona, in Alto-Piemonte. The area is cooler than for example Barolo, which makes for fresh, light, and early drinkable Nebbiolos.
* Foillard remains Foillard.",wine,1560150353,phonylady,3,14,True,2019-06-10

I know WE Classic's are the super budget option, but does anyone have any thoughts on them? Realistically, I don't think we need over a 100-bottle unit but we do have bottles of all the various sizes which really screw with the actual capacity of a fridge.

So, in short, in the $1k and under range, does anyone have any recommendations for wine fridges in the 90+ bottle range? Anyone with experience with WE fridges? How do they hold up?",wine,1560044100,alelock,7,7,True,2019-06-08

3,[UPDATE] Riesling with Fried Chicken,"Thank you for all of the recommendations yesterday!  Since most were recommending a dry Riesling, that's what I went with.  I decided to go with a Finger Lakes Riesling since I've heard a lot of good things about the region, but have yet to try it (and it was inexpensive).  I'm fairly new to ""tasting"" wine, but here are my notes:

Boundary Breaks Vineyard Riesling Dry No. 239 2017 (41 degrees; white wine glass)

Look: Light straw; slow legs

Nose: medium Pine-Sol (it's not uncommon for me to get this smell with Rieslings, but if anyone has a better descriptor, I'm open to suggestions), Meyer lemon, ripe nectarine (comes and goes), cantaloupe, and maybe a very slight minerality.

Palate: notice explosive acidity right away; lemon; fresh ginger, unripe nectarine; medium-long finish of lemon and soft minerals; high acidity; dry (not bone dry); no heat; light+ body

Overall thoughts: Energizes the mouth, but not too complex and the flavor seems a bit restrained; however, still a great wine.

Score: 90

This was a great wine (but I've yet to have a bad Riesling), but nothing especially noteworthy for a Riesling.  At 90 pts and $18, it's generally a very good value for me, but I honestly don't think it's better or significantly better than Kung Fu Girl, which I can get for $8 - $10 and I think is my biggest value buy (even though, I feel like Kung Fu Girl has some bottle variation).

I thought that this was a solid/good pairing with my fried chicken, as the acidity cut through the grease nicely, but it wasn't any thing particularly amazing or must have.  Next time, I might try an older dry Riesling, a most expensive/nicer dry Riesling, or perhaps try a Kabinett as I still think a young Kabinett or even Spatlese will really pop with fried chicken.

Thanks again for the suggestions!",wine,1560104176,IAmPandaRock,27,44,True,2019-06-09
4,Suggestions for ‚Äò96 Barolo,"Hi everyone,

My wife and I discovered Barolo and Barbaresco a little over a year ago, and have been obsessed ever since.  My parents also got hooked as a result of us.  We recently came across a bottle of 1996 Oddero Vigna Rionda and thought it‚Äôd be great to crack open with them.  The plan is to drink the bottle on Father‚Äôs Day with my parents at one of our favorite restaurants, or potentially just drink at home with a good meal (depending on the answer to the question below).

So here‚Äôs my question - how long should this bottle be decanted?  Is 8+ hours reasonable for a 23 year old Barolo, or would 2-3 hours do the trick?  I‚Äôve read a couple mixed things, so would some guidance from everyone here as this is the first time we are drinking a Barolo (or any wine) with this much age on it. 

Also, i‚Äôm anticipating the cork breaking, and heard cheese cloths are the way to go to filter out the cork.  Is there any reason why a cheese cloth would not be recommended in this case (e.g., can the cheese cloth negatively impact the wine)? 

If you have any other suggestions/things to consider, please let us know.

Thanks!

TLDR: First time drinking a 20+ year old Barolo - want to know how long to decant for, is cheese cloth okay for filtering out broken cork, and looking for any additional advice.",wine,1560107673,jthood65,6,3,True,2019-06-09

It's clearly a form letter, but I appreciated the response nonetheless.  I thought it would be beneficial to those of you who have been using the site:

&amp;#x200B;

Hey this is Jeff- your message just bubbled up to me and I wanted to personally respond to give you an update on your shipment.¬†   


First of all, thank you so much for your extreme patience with us getting your bottles out to you.¬† This delay is not acceptable- and I am embarrassed, to say the least.  


As you may know, we are a really small startup company being run by just myself and a handful of friends.¬† Right now we‚Äôre going through some extreme growing pains.¬† This all started when we went out to raise a round of venture capital funding which we needed in order to keep the company alive and growing.¬† These potential investors wanted to see us grow the company rapidly in order to write us a check. So we took them up on their request and took on so much growth that we couldn‚Äôt keep up or pump the breaks fast enough.¬† Within just 6 months, we exploded our sales over 350%. We didn‚Äôt yet have the team or infrastructure in place to support it. And we‚Äôre feeling it right now.¬† Right now we have 1,400 customer shipments that need to go out, and over 52 pallets (35,000 bottles) of mixed cases of wine we need to audit and receive into the CloudCellar.  


I realize that none of this truly matters ‚Äì you just want the wine that you paid for. I totally get that. I just wanted to be transparent and let you in on the specifics of what‚Äôs going on here.  


The great news is that the investors were so impressed by our growth that they invested $2.6 million dollars into the company, and the funds hit our account last week.¬† Suffice to say, we‚Äôre ecstatic for what this will mean for Underground Cellar, and I‚Äôm most excited about finally making things right for our loyal customers like you.  


First item of business? Getting your shipment out.  


We‚Äôve already gotten out a few hundred shipments this week, and are working our way through the backlog.¬† We‚Äôll be emailing you separately with an update on your shipments, as well as sending your tracking numbers as they ship.¬† We‚Äôre up against the clock on getting them out before the weather heats up too much; and where we can, we are including free ice packs in the shipments for you as well.¬†   


We‚Äôve also been hard at work optimizing our infrastructure, in fact we‚Äôre in the process of moving our CloudCellar to a brand new facility in Napa Valley, that not only can support our growth but also has a tasting room where you can visit your bottles and drink them with friends!! More details to come on this.  


Most of this new capital will be spent on hiring a world-class team, so we can ensure that these types of growing pains never have to impact you again. It‚Äôs a lofty goal, but we‚Äôre confident we can do it.  


My team and I will stay in touch as we know more about when your wine will ship out. We are going to get as many of these 1,400 backlogged shipments out as fast as we can before the temps get too high, but this realistically leaves us just 2-3 weeks. Rest assured my team and I have made this our [\#1](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fundergroundcellar.zendesk.com%2Fhc%2Frequests%2F1&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C607cec154d3b4c7b6c8608d6eab6f4ff%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636954468845799784&amp;sdata=WRfptKI%2BXFzqi3DgFxoNtHKz%2F6f0P2a6sudpSX1jQuM%3D&amp;reserved=0) priority, but please know that there is a chance that if some of your bottles are on those pallets that still need to be checked in, that we may not be able to get your package out until the weather cools off again. Of course, we‚Äôll do everything we can to avoid this, and we will keep you updated along the way as well. You shouldn‚Äôt have to be tracking us down for answers, so I will see to it that we drastically increase our communication cadence.w  


So, once again, thank you so much for your unbelievable patience and for your continued belief in us.¬† I know we may have let you down, but I promise that we will make things right for you if given the opportunity.¬† My ask of you is for just a little bit more of your patience so I can get you every one of your bottles and keep you a happy part of our Underground Cellar family.  


We‚Äôll be in touch soon.

7,Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for three separate dishes: Chicken Zucchini Yogurt Curry (Thai) / Asparagus Shakshuka / Tofu Broccoli Cabbage Noodles,"
For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals. If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components.



The first is a Chicken Zucchini Yogurt Curry (Recipe: https://properfoodie.com/thai-red-curry/)

The second is a Asparagus Shakshuka (Recipe: https://www.spainonafork.com/spanish-eggs-with-tomatoes-asparagus/ )

The final one is something with a Zucchini Pizza Crust (Recipe: https://www.ah.nl/allerhande/recept/R-R1188586/pittige-noedelroerbak-met-broccoli-en-teriyakitofu). This is in Dutch but can be translated through https://translate.google.com/

What would you recommend? We have a fairly varied cellar (though some notable wines are lacking). It can be found here, if you are willing to have a look: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CAD5Fq9UwDhwlNaDrWKpokaECe4Y0y0-HvCLCwvRo8/edit?usp=sharing

What I‚Äôd like to know is what are the best brands of wine in a typical grocery store, like Ralph‚Äôs, to look for     or if looking for the ‚Äúbest brands‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist at all and more comes down to one‚Äôs personal preference.

1,Question about a possible wine fault,"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I'm just trying to understand wine better. I opened a bottle the other day and as I was tasting it, I was really floored by how much my perception of it differed from the dozens of reviews I was reading of it on Cellartracker and Vivino. Like polar opposite. It was also exceptionally simple and devoid of a single remarkable note. I'm wondering if it is due to some sort of fault, and if so, what exactly.

The bottle was Abstract from Orin Swift (I know, I know). Most reviewers seemed to describe it pretty unanimously with terms like ""full bodied"", ""deep"", ""dark fruits"", ""smooth"", ""mocha"" etc. My bottle tasted medium bodied, acidic and tart, with some light fruits (green apple maybe?), and totally one-dimensional. There was just no complexity at all and it tasted very unremarkable. It didn't quite taste like vinegar, but the acids really dominated. And like I said above, there was not a single distinct flavor. If you had told me it was an $7 wine, I would have believed you without question. It didn't taste bad in any way, just totally absent of flavor, beside alcohol+acid+grape. I haven't even bothered to finish it.

Now, I know that Orin Swift has a particular high-extraction style that a lot of people don't like, but I'm not sure that's what the was problem here. I also tried to Machete, and it tasted very much as expected‚Äîdark, rich, smooth, and distinct; quite enjoyable and very consistent with the reviews I had read about it. This on the other hand just tasted totally generic, as if all delicate flavors had been cooked out of it or something.

So I'm thinking there are 3 or so possibilities:

1. There was some sort of wine fault that caused this particular bottle to diverge from the intended result.
2. This sort of wine (grenache-based) is just not for me.
3. This wine is actually just shitty and people only rated it highly because of the label.

Anyway, I'm curious to hear thoughts on this. I'm relatively new to wine, and I've already had one or two other (nicer) bottles like this where the wine just tasted really bland and absent of any distinct notes. Thoughts?",wine,1559533915,executivesphere,17,6,True,2019-06-02

&amp;#x200B;

So, Last months challenge was not popular at all!  Not sure why, maybe it was a harder to find wine for most people?  No one said anything, so I'm not sure what happened.  So at any rate, I think I will use this month to hopefully get us back on track with a wine that will be much easier for people so source. While it may be a but out of place in the summer, our selection may work well as a BBQ wine.  So, with that in mind, our selection this month is back to a red wine, and is:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Country: France\*\*

\*\*Variety/Varietal: Bordeaux Rouge\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Thats right! Those wonderful, full bodied red blends known the world over!  Blended from primarily merlot, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon, red bordeaux also permits petit verdot, malbec and carmenere, and depending on which side of the Gironde the wines are made on, can be either cab sauv or merlot dominated. 

So, just like with past MWC entries, on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.).

3,A question on alcohol and balance,"The manager at my restaurant bought a few cases of a Nero d‚Äôavola for us to begin stocking. I tasted it today, and for the most part, it is quite good. It has a really vibrant acidity to balance its youthful tannin, yet the alcohol was strong enough to overpower much of its flavor. I checked the label, and it‚Äôs ABV was 14%, which, of course, has some room for error. I know that acidity can balance alcohol, and since this wine was magnificently acidic, I wonder if I am truly detecting a flaw, or if I am just recognizing my own personal preference. Other coworkers agreed with me, but their wine knowledge isn‚Äôt to a point where I feel comfortable ruling out confirmation bias. Even with soaring acidity, and being otherwise well-balanced, could this wine still just be too high in alcohol? Further, I am bringing my aerator into work tomorrow so we can do a side by side test. Though this is suboptimal compared to a true decanting, it is more practical for the industry. Is there anything else we could do when serving it to reduce this fault? Save for serving it with a big gamy piece of meat, I guess. 

Interested to hear your ideas!",wine,1559392120,RowanOakTree,11,8,True,2019-06-01
4,prices of high-end/reserve Portuguese wines - Portugal vs USA,"So I've been in Portugal for the 2nd time this year beginning this past week, and I've noticed a rather large discrepancy in the pricing of higher-end wines here vs back in the USA.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that once you get to the top offerings of producers here in all regions (except those around Lisbon), the retail prices skew significantly higher than in the USA. For example, a bottle of the 2013 P√™ra Manca Tinto by Cartuxa - the most recent vintage available for retail sale in the USA, is on average  ‚Ç¨300-350/btl  in Portugal compared with only $240-$290 by retailers in the USA, almost  ‚Ç¨80/$90 cheaper (accounting for USA local sales taxes). I was told by the staff at a wine shop in Porto that the high price comes from a huge demand of top wine from particular producers by customers from/in Brazil and Lusophone Africa. I was also told that demand for vintage port is going up steadily in Europe.   


It seems a similar price discrepancy is affecting wines from Casa Ferreirinha, Wine &amp; Soul, and Quinta do Vale Me√£o.   


I'm guessing that some of the difference simply has to do with not as extensive familiarity of Portuguese red wine in the US retail market, but it just seems like a huge difference to me, so much so that as an American visitor its probably better to taste the wines in Portugal but buy it back home if it's available. In Italy it seemed almost the the opposite, as even the top wines were significantly cheaper there than in the USA.",wine,1559401959,tokyorevelation9,9,8,True,2019-06-01
5,"Help on how to be a ""Wine Liason""","Hi all, this is my first time checking out this sub but I think I might join now...any way, I just started working at a new modern upscale winebar, with wine ""taps"" (it's a tap for a bottle on display in a case, 5 wines per case. self serve, can get 1, 2 or 5 oz) but fast paced very cool spot. they haven't opened yet and I've been helping a lot with setup, two days ago I put away hundreds of bottles of wine in storage in open cabinets under the machines and in big wine fridges. I learned a lot of labels and names but other than that not much. 

Then today a couple wine distributors came in and taught us a lot about wine 101 and then a ton about specific wines we have, I took extremely detailed notes since I thought I would become a server here. Then later one of the distributors asked to meet with the ""Wine Liasons"" (just sommeliers but like more chill I guess?) but my manager told me to go with the Liasons instead of the servers, I have minimal exp with wine so I figured they wanted me to get some wine knowledge for serving. 

Then after the training I go hop in on the server training, my manager finishes and goes to me ""How would you feel about being a wine Liason?"" and I was pretty dumbfound considering I'm 18...another server chirped in going ""I could do it and I'm of age if you need!"" and my manager dissed him then turned back to me.  I told her I would think about it, then asked if we could have a sit down about it later. 

TL;DR Im 18 and was asked if I wanna be a ""wine Liason"" in a mod self serve wine bar, I am extremely interested and love learning, id consider myself pretentious about everything I buy, but I'm modest, I think I look the part but I'm trying to learn without trying wine. Any tips or advice?

To put simply you clean it whack some juice water yeast and some chemicals for clearing and your done right?

Fundamentally there is no difference between a demijohn/bucket and a 100 gallon vat of the stuff. So once you stop making rookie mistakes (e.g forgetting to sterilise) your on the long road to becoming a pro but what exactly do you learn on that long road to becoming a master craftsman. Winemaking isn't like fixing a car where you could say ""your not ready to work on Ferrari go fix a Fiat."" Because as soon as you start your in the thick of it there seems to be little learning curve, it either ends up wine, vinegar or rocket fuel.

For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals. If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components.



The first is a Beef Burger (Bunless Onion) with Grilled Vegetables (Recipe: https://www.primaverakitchen.com/easy-low-carb-bunless-burgers/)

The second is a Halloumi Pumpkin Beet Tomato Casserole (in Dutch) (Recipe: https://koken.vtm.be/open-keuken-met-sandra-bekkari/recept/ovenschotel-met-butternut-rode-biet-en-gekarameliseerde)

The final one is something with a Lentil Crust Pizza with Mozzarella and Veggies
 (Recipe: http://lemonsandbasil.com/rustic-roasted-veggie-pizza-lentil-crust/ ).

I have a Coravine'd Robert Mondavi Chardonnay 2011 I believe might suit the Halloumi dish decently.

This is my first post so I hope I will be doing this right. If not, do let me know. I am really liking this community so far!

Here goes.

Last time I visited my grandma, my dad an I cleaned out her wine cellar as some bottles in there were really ancient. We found a 2003 bottle of Klevener de Heiligenstein (Alsace, savagnin rose). We realized it was probably long past its prime as these wines usually keep 5 to 10 years max as far as I've read but he thought it would be a shame to just throw it away as it was probably a decent bottle back in the days. So my dad made me take it home with me.

I decided to open it this week, thinking I would either cook with it if still okay, or just pour it down the drain if not. And here comes the surprise: it was actually pretty damn good. 

Deep golden color, the look of an old Alsace. Stone fruits (peach, apricot) and flowers (cherry, rose) on the nose. A bit of added minerality on the palate. Relatively sweet but incredibly aromatic. Overall, pretty delightful.

I don't know if I did this right, I'm not a pro at wine tasting and describing sensations. Regardless, I had a great time with this bottle and thought I would share. You can always be surprised by the odd old bottle!",wine,1559110984,Nero_killed_Bambi,3,28,True,2019-05-29

Well im 4 weeks in and ive come to realize this class is a glorified syllabus. Instructor interaction is minimal- they only comment on your tasting notes and the only feedback I've gotten on those is to nitpick about the format of my notes.

I've reached out to the customer service and of course they say no refunds since we are half way through the class, but I feel like this class is honestly a rip off. So fair warning, maybe i was just a huge sucker, but dont expect much from this course.

1) Is it tacky to ask how long a bottle has been open? 

2) Do servers hate when people ask to taste, see the bottle, etc.?

3) Is it okay to send btg wine back if it is bad (not just ""oh, not what I thought it would be"")?

When I'm at a place where I'm a regular or sitting at the bar I am generally comfortable asking to see the bottle or pressing for more information. Often bartenders will offer a taste for free. I always tip well, but I want to be sure I'm not being le worst customer!

0,"Can we have ""pharmaceutical booze"" with benzodiazepines?","Alcohol's mental effects are GABA receptor agonism.

Benzodiazepines, like valium, knolopin also agonize GABA receptors with less nasty side effects compared to alcohol and alcohol metabolites.  Much less headache, nausea, high blood pressure side effects compared to alcohol for the same anxiolytic and depressant effects.

&amp;#x200B;

So what will happen if we remove ethanol from the wines we produce, and add a tiny amount of valium/knolopin to emulate the central nervous effects of ethanol? Maybe also add some tasty stuff to mask the bitter taste of valium. Is this pharmaceutical booze healthier than wine/liquor?

4,What Arrogation?," 

# [The Wine Tribune](https://thewinetribune.wordpress.com/)

Championing the Modestly-Scaled and Affordably-Priced in Socio-Historical Context

 

‚ÄúThis process of arrogation has produced more than a mere imbalance of focus.¬† It has successfully reshaped the very societal perception and understanding of what is most important about and central to the nature of wine as a widely enjoyed beverage.‚Äù

**One stated intent for this blog is to employ a socio-historical perspective**to shed light on the arrogation and skewing of popular journalistic wine discourse on behalf of the small percentage of affluent elites. For our purposes, I define these as persons with ample disposable incomes who can comfortably afford to produce or purchase wines that to the vast majority of wine drinkers are, even occasionally, conspicuously unaffordable.

This process of arrogation has produced more than a mere imbalance of focus.¬† It has successfully reshaped the very societal perception and understanding of what is most important about and central to the nature of wine as a widely enjoyed beverage.

**I have chosen ‚Äòarrogation‚Äô** because it seems the most apt term to describe the situation I seek to illuminate and contextualize: an unwarranted process by which the allocation of attention and content among the highest profile, most cited, most influential producers of cognitive materials available to and known by consumers has been and remains selectively weighted toward the interests of the affluent.

The focus of this arrogation is emphatically not limited to the establishment wine magazines and rating publications, although **The Wine Spectator**, **The Wine Advocate**, and their ilk certainly stand tall in the ranks of those implicated. Rather, it takes place across the broad range of cognitive channels ‚Äî magazines, books, apps, websites, reference works, retail shelves, popular entertainment, online courses, and actual classrooms ‚Äî to name the most obvious.¬† Its primary orientation is neither professional nor technical, though there is some necessary overlap.

**Changing Patterns of Function, Distribution, and Socio-Economic Consumption**

Wine has, for millennia, been an affordable home accompaniment to meals, to relaxation, and to social interaction for uncounted generations of ordinary people fortunate enough to live in, or in close proximity to, grape growing regions.

**In the last 150 years, ever-accelerating industrial-technological developments** in production, transportation, distribution, marketing, and merchandising have made affordable wines available to buyers living far from wine-producing areas. The great majority of these consumers also drink less-expensive wines that suit their incomes, tastes, and foodways.

During much of that period and before, a tiny segment ‚Äî the wealthy, the traveled, the collectors, and the frequenters of elite restaurants in the most affluent urban areas ‚Äî did learn about and limit their selections to the ‚Äòfine‚Äô wines of the ‚Äònoble‚Äô producing areas: Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, and the top German estates. ¬†Until the post-WWII era, the lists in those elite restaurants and the racks in private cellars reflected the tastes of that class. ¬†And due to the paucity of demand, those wines ‚Äî though far too expensive for the mass of wine consumers to buy \[and even more so to embark upon the process of learning about and accessing\] ‚Äî were by present-day standards, stunningly inexpensive.

Nonetheless, the great mass of the benighted knew only the home-made wines, non-grape ‚Äòwines‚Äô, inferior domestic fortified wines of all sorts, California jug wines, New York state ‚ÄòChampagne‚Äô, and inexpensively produced imports such as straw-flask Chianti and Liebfraumilch and the like.

**In the latter half of the 20th** **century, American society underwent a major change in its relationship to wine.** Until then, the regular consumption of table wine had been limited to the upper and lower ends of the income scale.¬† At the lower end were immigrant, ethnic \[meaning mostly Southern, and some Eastern, European\], low-income, working-class households ¬†¬†At the upper, were those in the primarily upper-middle professional, managerial classes \[who consumed any alcohol at all at meals\] and those in the upper class who could afford the imported noble wines cited above.

But beginning mainly in the Seventies, affordable California wines of quality, and a broader range of imports transformed American tastes and preferences for and in wines. It became possible for mainly college-educated middle-class wine lovers to search out the occasional lower-classified or unclassified Bordeaux, Burgundy, or German wine or the more increasingly widely available ‚Äòestate bottled‚Äô Californians.¬† Soon wine consumption boomed.

**This is the situation that prevailed after the booming post-war economy had made possible exploding college attendance, world \[especially European\] travel, and upscale explorations of less provincial lifestyles.** The children of the upper-middle class, who had flocked to the campuses and foreign flight terminals came home to a land of opportunity and TV cooking shows. ¬†Soon, the eldest component of the campus left began their grand ‚Äî and always carefully self-justified ‚Äî metamorphosis from counterculture/ hippies to yuppies; from saving the world from America to consuming it, most comfortably, in America.

These now-boomer/yuppies, with or without trust funds, got the good jobs and the incomes they yielded, most of them in metropolitan hubs of the production of taste, trends, and information and in university town/research centers \[frequently state capitals as well\]. ¬†Soon, an estimated $11+ trillion avalanche of depression-era parental savings-become-boomer-inheritances provided even more funds for bigger homes in enclaved, elite zip codes, for more travel, and for the pursuit of more rarefied consumption patterns.

Inevitably, many of these moved into the expensive wine-and-vineyard-buying class spurred more by affluence than by real connoisseurship. The now-affluent, antinomian occupiers of campus hotspots and devolved Eugene McCarthy/McGovern supporters now found themselves occupied‚Ä¶.by the serious need of reliable guidance in selecting what wines to cellar, to invest in, to talk about, to appear to have thought about, and to order as accompaniments to the geometricized thimblefuls of elaborately presented, expropriatively priced, frequently bland *nouvelle cuisine* then regnant in trendy restaurants.

**The yuppies needed easy access to reliable wine-buying recommendations**based on the broad and thorough tasting of each new vintage rather than on producers‚Äô reputations alone. And, behold, the need was met by two publications from the West and East coasts ‚Äî like nearly all *dei ex machina*¬†ideations serving our post-60s elites ‚Äî that had already been in operation since the mid/late 70s:¬† **The Wine Advocate** \[Robert Parker\] and its slightly older California-based cousin, **The Wine Spectator** ‚Äî both utilizing easy-to-remember 100-point rating systems for devotees to inflict on retailers and¬†sommeliers; and both sharing a preference for highest-rated, super-concentrated, super-expensive fruit bombs; ¬†often, in those days, super-oaky as well.

These recommended wines became ever-more-expensive as insistent demand for 90+ ratings increased. Armed with certified lists of the ‚Äòbest‚Äô wines, yuppies and their subsequent-generational equivalents needed only the wealth to afford the soaring prices.

And they had it.

1,Mousiness or mousy wines (fault),"More and more I've come across this in wines, specifically those made naturally or without SO2. I'm a huge fan of natural wine or those made in a minimal interventional style but this for me is an absolute killer. I've been at a number of natural wine fairs recently and found up to 20% of bottles can carry this fault.

For me it comes to the fore on the finish, which is all the more frustrating. It's undetectable on the nose and often on the palate it can seem promising but then upon spitting/swallowing the fruit fades and all that's left is a persistent mustiness.  This is then a very hard taste to get rid of, it also seem to become more prominent the longer a bottle has been open. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if this is something that varies person to person or whether it's a taste issue. Colleagues tasting the same wine haven't either picked it up of found it offensive. For me once I taste it there is no enjoyment to be found in the wine which is really unfortunate.

4,I'd like to work harvest somewhere in Europe. I only speak English.,"I'm an American living in Amsterdam.  I am taking two weeks holiday in late summer / autumn and was hoping to work harvest somewhere at a small producer in Champagne, but am learning that my lack of French is a problem.  I also don't have any experience, just a deep interest in wine.

I'm not looking for tourism, I'm looking to work and learn.  I'm fine with getting coffee and spraying down the tanks, but I'd prefer to work in the vineyard.   I'm not picky about region or varietal/style, I don't think, but Champagne is my true passion and I would prefer it to anything else.  I'm flexible with time and can effectively take off anywhere in September and October.  There's also a couple months to try and pick up some language, which I'm willing to do if it'd be effective.

5,Hoping that someone knows,"Greetings all wine lovers,

I have this one bottle that I've been keeping for quite a long time, I can even hardly remember when exactly I got this. 

Because I am not a well-learned in terms of the world of wines (I'm rather fond of whiskies, apparently), I never had the chance to try this one, and in fact, it didn't even cross my mind for quite some time. Now, that I've re-discovered it after a long time, I've noticed that this is -maybe relatively- an old bottle (been with me for many years). Now, I can't help but wonder several things:

1) Is it vinegar already, or did I accidentally do something good and it is better now (in terms of maturing/aging)?

2) Does anyone know of this particular bottle or the brand at least? My internet searches did not reveal anything useful.

3) Provided that it's a porto wine and its not vinegar by now, any idea regarding the market value?

6,Underground Cellar - recent experience and outlook,"Has anyone been using Underground Cellar to purchase wine over the past several months? TL;DR - I've been a customer since they were very new (about 4-5 years ago) but have noticed a few recent changes for the worse:

1. Fulfillment and logistics are a mess.  Their entire model of ""store the wine until you're ready to ship, and then we get it right out to you"" has been severely compromised, and if they're to be believed it's because of hypergrowth.  Regardless, instead of shipping the next day it can take weeks (or months) before that happens. This is a new development but has been happening more consistently over the past year.
2. There are now bottles ""ready to ship"" that have an emblem indicating it can take 2-3 weeks or more before they can ship.  They say it's because they come from a separate warehouse.  It seems incredibly contradictory to say something's available when it really isn't.  This is a brand-new development and a real problem.  
3. The ""offers"" are different than they used to be.  Aside from high roller offers, most seem to be comprised of 60-80% unknown or very unproven wineries as the upgrades, with the lowest and highest priced bottles being the ""names"".  In other words, they've mostly become a showcase for unknowns which is a clear pivot from the early days.  I assume they buy out those stocks at a steep discount in the name of promoting brands.  

I'm still a loyal customer because overall I've been upgraded to some great bottles, along with discovering some I would never have chosen.  They send out great discount codes with some frequency, and in general I think they have a great business model. I also really like the people I've dealt with there.  Hopefully this is just growing pains because their business really is thriving, but my skepticism is starting to increase.

Having tasted a few Opus Ones I know it's a fantastic bottle of wine but, other than brand recognition, what are the actual merits and justifications for the cost of such a bottle? Is this the Lamborghini if wines, beautifully made but wholly unnecessary?

I have existing commitments to my previous career through the end of Summer, but after harvest, I'll be entering the industry full-time.

There's a fairly nice restaurant close to me that I've visited many times, not enough that I'm a regular, but enough that I've been helped by their sommelier (who holds an advanced CMS certification) several times, and the nature of her service was instrumental in my choosing this industry. Her approach is very unique: descriptive, poetic, lots of storytelling when she's describing wines, but not tiring in its verbosity. Aside from that, her recommendations have always been impeccable. I deeply admire her style and skill and if I want to learn the ropes from anyone, it's her.

18,Need ideas/help on branding a rice wine product.,"Hi, I am trying to come up with a brand name for a series of rice wine product and need some ideas. 

If we end up using your feedback, we will be happy to pay a fee for your idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

The series of wine are made in a similar way.

They are all fermented from rice (majority) and a fruit.

The fruit can be strawberry, kiwi, etc., but just one fruit. 

So the products are kiwi rice wine, strawberry rice wine, etc. 

They tastes like sweet rice wine plus the fruit flavor.  

We expect women customers  and desert wine drinkers will like it. 

The products have sweeter or sour than regular sakes which have a plain and straight alcohol taste.

Welcome any ideas/suggestions. 

If we use your ideas, we will PayPal you $100. 

Thanks!

0,2014 Trump Winery New World Reserve,"Tasting notes: Color is deep red, almost purple center and ruby at the edge. Nose of cherry and a bit of oak. Flavors of black currant, bing cherry, tannins are medium high, acidity medium high, and a hint of oak and spice. 13% ABV. 52% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Franc, 12% Petite Verdot, 8% Malbec. The taste lingers for a few minutes on the back of the tongue. Very dry. It has not reached its prime yet and could still probably age for another 5+ years. Tasted initially and then decanted for 30 minutes. Decanting did bring out some more subtle raspberry notes on the nose and the palate. It is definitely a bold, young, tannic red.

&amp;#x200B;

Story time: It spent 18 months on new French oak and then about a year in the bottle.  This wine is 100% estate grown and bottled in Charlottesville, Virginia in the Monticello AVA. All of the still Trump wines were estate grown and bottled through the 2016 vintage. I worked at the winery for a few months in 2016. I tasted this wine on release and it has come a long way from where it was then. It was VERY tannic and mouth puckering with plenty of oak. 

&amp;#x200B;

The winery is owned by Eric Trump. After Donald Trump announced his candidacy and later won the election, the bottles were flying off of the shelves. In order to meet demand, the winery had to start buying grapes from other vineyards. They have more than 300 acres under vine on a gorgeously manicured property. In my opinion, these are great quality wines. I highly recommend the sparkling wines from Trump Winery. The winemaker, Jonathan Wheeler, makes beautiful sparkling wines in the traditional method. I will post a review the next time I pop open a bottle.",wine,1557883805,reddthey,1,1,True,2019-05-14

3,Ideas for Winning and Losing Team in Blind Wine Tasting,"My friends and I take turns hosting wine tastings and we're hoping to change things up a bit at the next tasting. Here is the idea - each group (couple) of two brings 3 bottles, one bottle which costs approximately $10, one which costs approximately $20, and one which costs approximately $50, all of the same varietal and vintage. Varietals will be assigned before the tasting, and vintage is up to the team buying the bottles. The group of two who brought the wine will then pour a glass of each for each participant, and the other teams of two will try to guess the order of the wines in terms of cost. Each player on each team will rank the wines - with a point awarded for each wine you get correct (max score of 6 per team per round, and minimum score of 0). Whichever team has the highest score at the end of the night wins, and gets X, while the losing team gets Y.

11,So a quick chat about ideal temperature for cellaring...,"I've looked back, and not seen this conversation in some time. I've finally amassed enough of a collection that I want to put my internal dialogue to bed, and just stop worrying and learn to just drink the damn wine and not keep wondering about temperatures.  

Most of my collection are Sonoma Coast and Willamette Pinots, with a whole bunch of random new and old world Cabs/Zins/Cab Franc/Negrette. I can't imagine trying to cellar anything for 20+ years, I guess. Originally, I had my smaller collection in an upstairs cupboard, where the temps were even worse than what they are now.  

The place I found in my basement closet isn't as cool or consistent as I thought, but is very dark, still (no vibration), quiet enough to be perfect, but I misjudged the temp being in the mid-50s year round, and it's more like low to mid 60s.  Specifically, the humidity is 48-62%, at 55% most of the time, and 61-73 degrees F, usually around 65-68 degrees F.

I've seen a lot of skepticism about the real world importance of keeping a constant temperature, people joking that those people are just trying to sell wine fridges.  I know a decent Pinot can cellar well past the normal 5 years and into 8-10 yrs+, but I do plan to turn the collection as much as possible and enjoy it. I've enough fun opportunities to get to some big discounted sell offs, so I can restock some bottles that have been properly cellared over decades.  And if I really was going to find and drink something REALLY special, I prefer a pro having cellared it vs me taking care of it for long.  I also like the notion of not adding a carbon footprint to my wine cellar with power consumption.

But when the temp creeps over 65, I start overthinking about whether I should vent HVAC into there, which would be an insane project, or buy a wine fridge that would fit the space.  If I did have the time and money to go a little deeper than my current collection, and collect some special stuff, would it be more important than my current collection?  Or is the whole notion of ""keep right at 55"" a little fastidious and a bit of overkill for normal home collectors vs industry pro wineries, cellars, restaurants, etc?

Conversely, what do people think about storing champagne and sparkling, whites, rose, dessert wines in a fridge, at approximately 40 degrees F? Some are concerned about the humidity, and the chance of a cork drying out, while others think it should be fine to store wines at that temperature, over long periods of time (months to a year, not years).  

Would love to get to the science and facts of the matter, vs the theatre, agendas, and fussiness of the industry (like the Reidel guy saying everything should be decanted, even champagne).

0,Is There a Wine I Would Like?,"This is probably the wrong place to post, so feel free to redirect me to another sub.

The few times I've had wine (or anything else alcoholic) was years ago, and was just a sip at Kiddush or on Passover. I never liked it from a taste perspective. It always tasted like my mouth was drying up and then I didn't like even the tiniest bit of the burningness from the alcohol itself. It seemed like someone took a perfectly good drink, grape juice, and let it go bad (I know that's kind of what it is, but still, I think you get my point). I also don't like how I perceive the effects of alcohol; people describe it as a sense of losing control, and I get how that can feel freeing for some, but for me, I just think, ""that sounds awful,"" and from how I see people who are drunk behave, it's not really something I want to be a part of.

However, despite this, here is why I feel like there might be some kind of wine that I would like. I find that grape juice, while good, is often *waaaay* too sweet, as are most fruit juices. I also like tea, especially Earl Grey, which has some of those tannins, but with tea, I like the slight drying-up-ness, but it's still overall refreshing. I also like hibiscus tea. Reading through a bit of the links in the sidebar, I know that some of my favorite fruits are raspberries and blackberries. Much less natural, but I also like sour candies. To me, these things (well, except the sour candy), seem like they share a lot flavor features with the kinds of features wine has, so if it weren't for the much more dryingness than tea and any burning sensation, I feel like I'd like it.

What do you guys think? Is there a kind of wine I could enjoy (maybe like a low alcohol wine?), or no? I'm good with either answer, but figured I'd see what you guys think.

I have room for a small wine cooler in the new kitchen that I‚Äôm installing.  So I have been looking specifically at 6/7 bottle 15cm slim coolers.  There are quite a few on the market, but a lot of reviews say that they can‚Äôt accommodate Champagne or Prosecco bottles.  Now this may not be the end of the world, but I definitely want it to be able to accommodate traditional Chardonnay bottles as well as just Bordeaux bottles.

Is there anyone here that owns one of these coolers that can help me out and let me know whether Chardonnay bottles will fit.

Also, is there generally an issue with the doors having to be opened really wide to be able to get the bottles in and out?

7,Cypriot Wineries Visit,"Visited 2 Cypriot wineries today as part of the annual Open Doors day organised by 5 Wineries in the Limassol Wine Villages area. 

Overall thoughts: Quality of the wines just keeps improving and after meeting the people behind the labels, one can witness the knowledge and dedication driving the improvement. Really glad to have tasted almost the full range of both wineries and would recommend anyone to check them out if you are ever on holidays here! 

Vlassides Winery standout labels: the reds and especially the Merlot and the Opus Artis label (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blend). The Grifos 2 label which is a blend of the indigenous Cypriot variety Xynisteri and Sauvignon Blanc was also a welcome surprise to me.  

Zambartas Winery standout labels: especially liked the Rose (Cabernet Franc and Lefkada blend) and the Mataro(Mourvedre) ‚Äì Yiannoudi (another indigenous variety) blend. The Lefkada-Shiraz blend was also a exceptional and was presented as the premium label of the winery.

Below are the goodies I have purchased from both, along with a Prevoteau-Perrier Champagne (which I never heard of) and new glasses from a shop in Limassol that we visited to end an amazing wine-themed day (as you do üôÑ)",wine,1557603743,hhomie11,0,1,True,2019-05-11

However, for many years he had a personal fruit farm and vineyard. He took good care of his vineyard and each year would make wine from his grapes. I've been lucky enough to have visited out there several times throughout the years but never got the story of how he made his wine personally. I have seen his wine barrels though and know he kept 7 full and on rotation and would retire one each year for new wood. Long story short is, there are now about 7 wine barrels full of his wine that are now just sitting there in his cellar and no one seems to care but me. My question is what can I do? I'm not extremely familiar with the wine making process (though I do love it and currently work at a brewery so do understand how to make alcohol). Is it a matter as simple as taking the wine from the barrels and bottling it or is there a more involved process?

4,Comically bad Wine Spectator experience. This is why print is dying.,"tl;dr: Subscribed to Wine Spectator specifically for access to a single online article. After a month of waiting for a physical issue so I could get online, turns out the print subscription doesn't entitle you to online access. Complain, they cancel my issues, can't issue me a refund. wtf.

Longer version: 

I'm pretty interested in Bordeaux, to a pretty obsessive level. When I saw Molesworth posted a pretty robust report on 2018 on Wine Spectator, I decided I'd subscribe just to get access to that. 

I shopped around a bit for a subscription, ended up buying it through BlueDolphin (they sell a ton of magazine subscriptions, usually a few bucks cheaper than going direct for whatever reason. Never had a bad experience). 

A week or so after I buy it, I ask Wine Spectator customer service if they could give me a login early because I don't want to wait for my physical issue to arrive, with my account number on it, to get my online access. They say they can't find me, whatever. So I wait until the actual issue shows up several weeks later. 

Try to login. Nothing but account management available. Wtf? 

Email them again. 

Apparently, buying a print subscription does not entitle you to online access. Not even the print articles that are posted online. 

They can't change my subscription to ""online only"" even though the subscriptions are supposedly the same price. Their solution? Cancel my print delivery, even though they aren't in a position to refund my subscription fee since I bought it through an agent, and despite my not asking them to do so.

What in the hell? I must be the only moron in the world who actually paid for Wine Spectator (vs getting it for free after they got my name somehow, for example), and they won't give me online access? Is this 2005? 

After weeks of waiting and money down the drain in an honest effort to pay for content, I'm just gonna find it reposted online like everybody else does. Absolutely ridiculous.",wine,1557159004,ScotchAndLeather,16,37,True,2019-05-06

When travelling in South France I saw a lot of vineyards and wineries, but rarely they had any advertising and wine shops. 

I wonder if it's a sign of old wine making culture, so as to not be annoying, and what a traveller's experience is like, buying wines far from tourist hotspots, and whether people use any mobile apps for this.

5,"Recommend me a ""typical"" Greek Wine?","I will admit, I know nothing about Greek wine.

When people talk about wine, they -- more often than not -- mean French or Italian, sometimes Spanish.

Or they opt for something simple, local.

&amp;#x200B;

My own experience with wine, so far, kind of reflects that.

Which I find very unfair, seeing how the Greeks were already making wine in the stone age and we have archeological evidence that suggests they introduced the wine to various European cultures, including the Ancient Egyptians and the Romans, starting  somewhen after 1700 BC.

&amp;#x200B;

I've  recently stumbled across an old German song that made me aware of this:

[Greek Wine by Udo J√ºrgens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBkPARPm-Mc)

Long story short: It's about a foreign worker who invited him to some wine.

The chorus goes like (the migrant speaking):

&gt;GREEK WINE is like the Earth's own blood!  
&gt;  
&gt;Come, pour yourself one.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if I later happen to become sad,  
&gt;  
&gt;It's because I'm always dreaming about home.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please forgive me.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;GREEK WINE and the old familiar songs!  
&gt;  
&gt;Pour another for I am again feeling the yearning.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this city, I won't ever be more than a foreigner  
&gt;  
&gt;and alone.

(I'll add a full translation to the end of this post.)

And while I do understand that the very strong emotions associated with the wine in this song stem from the migrant's missing his home, it made me curious and determined to have a  taste or two.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I do, of course, have my own preferences, I do want to hold myself back with restrictions on what you can recommend me. After all, I want to get to know wines that I know nothing about, not more of the same. :P

It should be Greek, obviously,  
unfortified,  
non-sparkling,  
and somewhat affordable (I want to *drink* wine, not put it on a shelf and never touch it again because it was ""too expensive to open""; if I were to set an arbitray limit, let's say max 60-ish Euros).

Maybe a small preference for reds, in keeping with the spirit of the song (""Earth's blood"") ;), although that's not a hard limit.

&amp;#x200B;

If possible, let me know why you recommend the particular wine you name. The internet is full of ""must try""s and ""Greek's best""s and whatnot. I'm much more interested in personal impressions.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, full translation of the song, as promised:

&gt;It was already dark when I was walking through suburb streets, towards home.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then I cam across an inn whose lights were still gleaming onto the pavement.  
&gt;  
&gt;I had time and I was cold, so I entered.  
&gt;  
&gt;Inside sat men with brown eyes and black hair  
&gt;  
&gt;And from the  Jukebox came music that was foreign and southern.  
&gt;  
&gt;When they saw me, one stood up and invited me:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;GREEK WINE is like the Earth's own blood!  
&gt;  
&gt;Come, pour yourself one.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if I later happen to become sad,

&gt;In this city, I won't ever be more than a foreigner  
&gt;  
&gt;and alone.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;And then they told mee of green Hills, of the Sea and of wind,  
&gt;  
&gt;Of old homes and young women who are alone,  
&gt;  
&gt;And of the child who had never seen their father yet.  
&gt;  
&gt;They kept telling themselves: somewhen, they would be going home,  
&gt;  
&gt;And that their savings would \[then\] be enough back home to set up a little something from which they could live  
&gt;  
&gt;And \[that\] soon, nobody would be thinking about how it had been here.

So far, I like drier or off-dry Rieslings or at least Rieslings that have ample acidity to balance out any sweetness, so I'm concerned that the wine will lose acidity as it ages and become too sweet.

1,Just finished our wine tour of Napa valley! Here is my breakdown from a complete wine amateur,"My wife and I within the last year juuuust started to get into wine. We would visit local wineries in Virginia and try different things. I like Chardonnay, she likes Pinto Grigio. Neither of us are big on reds, but we will try them. We had a wedding to go to in San Clemente, and since we were already flying across the US for this we figured we might as well head north to Napa.

Here is a breakdown of each place we visited in alphabetical order

**Cakebread Cellars** - I really enjoyed the little walking tour they took us on. This was our fifth winery, and the first that talked about the vine process. Felt very informed. Wine was solid, really liked the Chardonnay and Merlot. Took a bottle of Merlot home. 

**Castello di Amorosa** - Can i give this a negative rating? A ton of guides and reviews online said to check this place out, but it was just a tourist trap with meh wine. The server really wasn't into it and we we're happy to leave quickly. The little farm was cute though.

**Caymus Vineyards** - Our friends and my wife's sister both named dogs after this place, so we had to go. Interesting that it was really five? vineyards rolled into one, but we didn't mind. The wine was awesome, and if you bought a bottle your tasting acted as credit. It ended up being a solid deal for three bottles of wine and two tastings. Definitely would go back.

**Chateau Montelena** - Right, so....this is the place that put Napa on the map and they certainly let you know (they even asked if we wanted to purchase the movie about the French event!). The wine was alright, but the grounds were lovely. The Japanese garden and pond were cool to look around at. Glad we went, but no need to go back.

**Domaine Carneros** - a redditor recommended to start our day at this place, and they were spot on! The sparking sampler was perfect at 10am and the cheese to go along with it was great. The server was great and the view was AWESOME! Will definitely go back (bought a bottle of their Brut)

**Inglenook** - we were between appointments and decided to check this out. The grounds were lovely. We didn't notice a tasting, but instead bought a glass each to try as well as some jack cheese. They ran out of baguettes which my wife was very salty about haha. Wine was alright, I liked the view more though.

**Luna Vineyards** - Our dog's name is Luna and also my wife loves Pinot Grigio, so this was a must. And it was GREAT! Each wine we tried we loved. Ended up taking three home with us. The server was super nice and even joined us to chat for a couple of minutes between pours. Absolutely loved it.

**Robert Mondavi** - My wife was checked out at this point when we got here so she wasn't feeling it. We did the 5pm fireside tasting which, oddly enough, was around a fire place and had no actual fire. Several reserve wines (of unlimited pours!) and charcuterie, as well as a visit down to the cellar made this one great. Bought a bottle of the reserve Chardonnay. Would love to go back just for the regular tasting.

**Sterling Vineyards** - Ah the gondola. Yes, it offered great views and I do recommend it. Their opening wine on the self guided tour was wonderful (believe it was their sauvignon Blanc) but the rest were okay. The views though were the BEST in the valley.

**Whitehall Lane** - Again we found ourselves between appointments and stopped in. It was okay. Felt kind of like a ""we know why you're here. Give us $25 and taste four wines that are okay"". Nothing special really.

So that's it! We loved just driving around and taking in all the views. We are already planning to come back in roughly five years. Also, shipping wine to Virginia is a pain in the arse.

6,Good vs bad corkscrew?,"I have two corkscrews. One is a 'waiters corkscrew' and the other is one of those winged corkscrews with the levers on either side. I don't know what they're called. Our waiter corkscrew is cheap and doesn't seem to work very well. I don't think the actually corkscrew is centered so when you pull it out it doesn't catch the lip of the bottle. So I use the other one... But that one doesnt pull the cork all the way out. And that's where I run into my problem. Trying to wiggle the cork out sometimes breaks the cork becuase so much of it is still inside the bottle. I can't screw it down any further so I have to risk breaking it, or I have to pull it straight out and risk making a mess, like I did last night.

What are the main differences between a good and bad corkscrew? Is it the angle of our cheap corkscrew that sucks, or is it just a technique I'm messing up?

18,Recent tasting tour; Napa/Healdsburg,"For anyone looking for short background on Napa/Healdsburg places we tried:


Sun
Domaine Carneros
Started our Napa tour here as I have missed it that last 8 trips.  Beautiful grounds and scenery, and we have a mixed tasting with bubbly and pinots.   All the sparkling wine was delicious;  I prefer a certain Pinot type if i drink it, so I actually liked the lower end Pinot more than the heavier, mushroom laden high end pinots.  All good, just preferences!   Reservations recommended.   Bought home 3 bottles of sparkling.

Foley Johnson 
Stopped by here on a lark as it was next door to our private tour at Turnbull.  Wines are ok, tasting room average.  Host was wonderful and tipped her nicely and took home two bottles.  Foley owns a gazillion wineries around the world (and the Los Vegas Golden Knights).   Would not revisit wines.

Turnbull 
A family winery making absolutely outstanding wine.  Their 2017 Josephine Savignon Blanc was incredible.  Reserved the private tour again which is informative, entertaining, and a chance to have some of their very best.  We even snuck some wine right from the barrells.   Last tasting we got an incredible 2010 Merlot and older Leopoldina Cab (my favorite).  This time we tasted across their Cab vineyards, and then treated to their incredible Pierra Cabernet.  Also, their 2018 Rose sells out fast for a reason.  

Monday

Sequoia Grove
Just down from Turnbull is Sequoia, another place we love and is a family operation.  Sequoia has very specific flavor profile, and if you like bolder Cabs this is a good place... had their high end cab tasting and they poured some extras to try.  Tonella vineyard showed especially well.   The Cabernet Franc was quite good too.  Cambium never disappoints. Did some shopping as we love their logo and accessories (glasses, lotions).    Took home 6 bottles.

Pine Ridge - Stags Leap District
Headed to Pine Ridge for Cave Tour and Tasting.  Hands down learn the most on this tour of anywhere. Their demonstration vineyard is nice, but the cheese and wine pairing deep in the caves is wonderful.   Its a beautiful area and the wines a great compliment.   Bolder, complex cabs expected here and they deliver. Rose is too dry for me, but Jeff is the best tour guide in the valley.  

After this tour, we met privately with a great wine maker behind Chanticleer, Sleeping Giant, Little Giant, and many more.   Came away with a case of his delights!  I really enjoy these types of visits if you can set them up; the one on one with winemakers is fun to hear their backstory, approach, and vision for future!

Napa Cellars 
Really basic wines, and ones I tend to share with my family or friends as they are unassuming but ok introductions to Napa wines.  Serves to keep them away from my larger Napa collection.   Had the Meritage, which I always enjoy, and a Cab, Pinot, and Sauvignon Blanc.

Drove to Healdsburg, and first stop was at the ‚ÄúDarn Fine Barn Wine‚Äù J Rickards Winery.  Had a tasting and tour, and the owner of this family operation stayed with us for 30 minutes telling stories.  Really good wine, non Napa prices. We probably stayed for almost 2 hours. Tasted many Cabs, Petite Sirahs, Rose and more.  Ask what the owner discovered in his vineyards and has patent on!  Left with 6 bottles.

Family Wineries
This place has tastings for 5 wineries in one place, and 3-4 more around it.  Options is key word here, but the tasting is formulaic and rather disappointing.  However, the Collier Falls Primitivo was really tasty wine from the bunch.  Would not return.

Acorn
A family winery that specializes in field blends, the tasting takes place on their property.  The owners are delightful, and our host Natalie was so sweet.  Drank many different reds, and came home with 4 bottles.  Heritage Vines Zinfandel was really on point, Syrah was perfect for me, and Dolcetto was very good; I preferred the 2016 over the 2015.   Another winery where the quality and price ratio is very good!   

Portalupi
Right off Healdsburg Plaza, this small family winery specializes in Italian style wine.  We had a private tasting here, and the owner was very attentive.  She told us great stories about her family history, including the milk bottle wine.   We came home with 6 bottles, including two of the milk bottle wine.  So cool!  The charcuterie tray was delicious!!  Decently priced wine for its quality.  

Wednesday

Stags Leap Wine Cellars. - Stags Leap District
Fire and Water tour here for the first time.  I always stop here each trip as their SLV Cab was the big winner in Paris that put Napa Cabs on the map.  After a cave tour, had wine and cheese/chocolate pairing.  Tasted their Fay (water), SLV (fire), and the ‚Äújesus juice‚Äù Cask 23.  SLV has always been my favorite Cab.  We also got to taste a non buttery Chardonnay which was ok, and their Cerillius.  

**I can‚Äôt not mention La Gitana Taco Truck in Calistoga.  You need to stop here if you like street tacos or just very good Mexican food.  You will not regret it.**

Tamber Bey - Calistoga
Love horses, and can‚Äôt resist a working family owned horse ranch and winery.  Tasting was outside, and our host was having a ball with us.  Met some horses, had some great Cabs.  The Deux Chevaux Vineyard Sabino (Cab) was even better then their very popular and well regarded Rabicano Cab.  Took home 6 bottles.  

Tedeschi. - Calistoga
Small, family owned winery.  This family had the only winery on Maui for a long time!  Ashley was very knowledgeable, willing to share a lot of family history as she grew up near the family.  Decent wines, fair prices.   Nothing stood out however.  A little tricky to find!

Tank Garage Winery - Calistoga
Had to stop at this electic place inside an old service station.  Their Rose was very surprising, like a watermelon jolly rancher almost!  Just a cool vibe here, no pretension and really fun guests in here.  Everyone is relaxed and open.   We took home 3 from here;  a few Rose, and a Petite Sirah-led blend.  

Thursday

St. Supery - Rutherford
Last day!  Beautiful driveway and grounds.  Impeccable tasting room, and Billy was very engaging.  We spent a lot of time tasting across the elevations between their Rutherford Dust valley floor Cab and their Dollarhide Vineyards Cabs from different areas.   Their high elevation Dollarhide Cab is like a bounce house in your mouth, while that valley floor Cab was smooth as 007.

Conn Creek - Rutherford
Long time member here, and did the Salon tasting experience again pairing wines with cheeses.  We did a tasting across vintages from the Spring Mountain district.  Always really enjoy their bordeaux style cabs; the Anthology is great.  Their AVA specific wines are always very different year to year as they explore the grapes each year.  

Black Stallion - Stags Leap District
Ended up at an old time favorite;  a winery in a former horse ranch/stables.  We tasted across their various cabs, and then their Rose of Syrah, Rockpile reds, and Pinots.   The Transcendent Cab is particularly good, as well as their Gespare cab.  This place is very relaxed and great outdoor space.",wine,1556917351,route66speed,2,0,True,2019-05-03

If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed. Also my companion often makes changes to the recipes, e.g., we might not use an ingredient but will use the title components.

The first is a Mushroom Tofu Eggplant Bowl (Recipe: https://lovingitvegan.com/tofu-and-eggplant-bowls/)

The second is a Pork in Apple Mustard Sauce (Recipe: http://www.slimmingeats.com/blog/pork-loins-with-apples-mustard-sauce )

The closest thing to a cellar I have is a dark closet in the north side of my house. I plan to get a digital thermometer to see if the closet floors are noticeably cooler than the rest of the house, ideally under 70 degrees.

He then followed up if we wanted to talk to the Somm directly or if they should just choose for us. As I had given my thought I told him that the Somm could pick one out. 

I ended up with a 2014 northern Rhone Syrah that was super cherry fruity at first taste. My wife got a more olive flavor. Initially I was taken back a bit because I didn't expect cherry when I ask for earthy and as my wife really liked it, I just went with it. Thankfully the wine really opened up over our 2.5 our dinner and was a fantastic journey to see it bloom. It did get a bit earthy by hour 1 or so but not nearly as much as I expected.

I'm a 21y/o college student studying political science in Denver, Colorado. To help pay for tuition I've been working part time at a mid-range sushi restaurant for the past two and a half years.

I've been a huge foodie all my life, and to be able to pair it with my newly found passion for wine seems like a perfect fit for me. I'm currently studying for the level 1 - introductory sommelier exam (through the Court of Master Sommeliers) in July. I've been reading The Wine Bible, and pairing it with a subscription at [GuildSomm.com](https://GuildSomm.com). I've been frequenting wine shops and wine bars for the past 3 months in order to taste and learn more. I'm wanting to work in a higher end restaurant, or wine bar; or even a wine shop in order to help complement my learning. I'm afraid that without any type of certification I won't be accepted. Do you think a sommelier for a higher end restaurant would accept me as an apprentice or intern? Could I get a job in the wine cellar stocking or doing inventory? Are there any opportunities that I've not thought about that would help me pursue my goal? Any advice would be appreciated.

At anyrate, we will get back to a standard vinifera wine for this month.  So since May is the unofficial start to the sommer season around these parts, I decided to go with something that would make an excellent summer wine.  So, that being said, our selection this month is: 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Country: Australia\*\*

\*\*Variety/Varietal: Viognier\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Originating in the south of France, viognier can now be found around the world.  It is a highly aromatic grape with the ability to produce full bodied wines that can be either oaked or unoaked.  Expect to find notes of citrus, stone fruit, floral aromas, as well as vanilla and spice.

&amp;#x200B;

So, just like with past MWC entries, on the 15th of the month, I will post the tasting notes post.  Make sure your notes include: a) a link to a picture of the bottle and a filled glass; b) the name (if there is one), the producer, and the year; c) your notes; and d) your overall recommendation (whether great or gross, food pairings, etc.).

0,Help finding a wine that tastes like manure?,"Hi r/wine, thanks for reading.   


 I apologize in advance for any errors of etiquette that I make here. I do not drink a lot of wine. And I certainly do not remember *any* particular wines, except for one glass that I had at a wine tasting a little over two years ago, in a small shop in a small New Jersey river town. The tasting guide teased it a little at the beginning, getting all whispery and telling us that ""we have one wine that people say tastes a little bit like *shit,*"" and I was ready to really hate it, but she didn't announce it before she poured it and when I took a sip it tasted like I'd found a stable deep in the woods, all loamy soil and manure and I fell in love a little bit with it then. I mean, I love deep woods! And stables! But everyone was talking about how much it tasted like crap, so I didn't buy it (big mistake) and totally forgot what kind of wine it was (bigger mistake!) and now I don't know how to find it again.  


So: can anyone let me know what kinds of wine might have that sort of taste? And, if anyone works in a wine shop, can you let me know if it'd be totally insane to call them and ask them ""hey, did you store a wine that tasted like literal horse shit two and a half years ago?"" and expect them to remember what it was? Any help is appreciated!  


Gratuitous detail: It was not a high-end wine shop. It was not a blaufrankensch--that was the type of wine we tasted directly after it, and is the only name that I remember from that night. Definitely red. Not smoky, not sweet, not leathery, no tobacco (but if you know of any that have those flavors as well, I'd be down). I feel like if it had been something common, like a pinot noir, I'd have remembered what it was called and bought it soon after, but the style had a funky name and it slipped my mind.

It‚Äôs an 1848 Madeira by Henriques &amp; Henriques. It went into the cask in 1848 was bottled in 1927 and rebottled in 1957. This is marked bottle number 70 (from what I can tell there were 642 bottles). 

My grandparents don‚Äôt drink wine so this has sat in their cellar (where she stores the food she cans) since it was gifted to them in the early 60s (she can‚Äôt remember when or who gave it to them‚Äîjust that it was a gift so they put it away and forgot about it).

4,WSET Level 3 online- Does anyone else find the course as useless as I do!?,"So a bit of backstory. Initially I was signed up to take the 1 week intensive classroom course. Like a dummy I signed up during the busiest time of year for me at work (I work in wine wholesale/distribution as a sales rep). 

The week that the class was taking place two of our other reps were out of town so I took over their accounts, PLUS I had a friend in town visiting. I live on a small Caribbean island where the class/exam only happens once per year so I didn't want to wait until next year to write. I received my books in January and have been putting in 6-8 hours/week since then, so I figured I could take the online course and have a colleague blind taste me and I would be fine...

Where my gripe comes from is that I find the online course ABSOLUTELY USELESS. The videos about PGI/PDO's for each region are helpful, but god dammit the majority of the review questions are just awful. 

For instance I am on week 6 (Red, White and Rose of the Americas) and all the questions have been about Bordeaux (WTF). Not only that but they are super basic questions:

What grape is grown predominantly on the left bank?

Is Cabernet Sauvignon suitable for ageing?

Is Cabernet suitable for new oak?

I am of the opinion that these are basic questions even for WSET Level 2. Has anyone else taken the online course and felt the same way? I am super tempted to just scrap it and keep up studying my notes/using my blank maps. For $1600 this online course is absolute garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

Long time lurker here, looking for some input.  
Wife and I are headed for a 3 week trip to Italy in July, and I was wondering if anyone here had any experiences or recommendations to share!  


Specifically, we're covering the following regions:

Fly into Rome -&gt; Tuscany -&gt; Liguria (Cinque Terre) -&gt; Piemonte -&gt; Alto Adige -&gt; Fly out of Milan

We plan to spend between 2 - 4 days in each area before moving on, so will definitely budget time to hunt down some vino to drink and hopefully ship back home.  


So far, initial plans based on recommendations from friends / the internets:  
Tuscany, Montalcino area:  Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona, Podere Le Ripi winery visits  
Cinque Terre: Hoping to pick up a few bottles of Sciacchetra  
Piemonte, Barolo area: E. Pira &amp; Figli, hoping to visit Elio Altare

&amp;#x200B;

Few general / specific questions:

1. Feedback on the current lineup? Any other wineries that I should consider? 
2. Super tuscans: A friend familiar with the area suggests I avoid taking the extra time to visit the marquee super tuscan producers (e.g. Antinori, Ornellaia, etc.), says its overly commercial and not a great experience, plus their wines are usually available back home, albeit at a higher cost. Anyone thoughts?
3. Alto Adige: I'm not familiar with this area or its wines, but it comes highly recommended. Any particular styles / producers I should be looking out for or that I should try to visit?
4. Any other recommendations for wine in these regions? (I'm missing Veneto, but we decided to spend more time in Alto Adige and see the sights rather than squeeze in another area for a couple of days)
5. Broader recommendations on travelling the region also greatly appreciated.

3,"PSA: Last Bottle Marathon (9A PST Thursday, Apr 25)","FYI Last Bottle marathon tomorrow.  

For those who don't know, the marathon is pretty much Last Bottle's inventory clearance, where bottles stay up until they sell out (or it's just been up for awhile, in which case you can expect to see it again).  Everything ships free, so it's a great way just to try a few wines/regions/styles that you wouldn't have tried before.  Or a great way to load up on some favorites/classics.  

The wines vary tremendously in price, region, and style.  Screaming Eagle, first growth Bordeaux, cheap prosecco, dry and sweet german rieslings, vintage port, etc.  Some bottles are sold in extremely small quantities and sell out before you can even hit refresh, others stay up longer.

I would definitely tune into the first hour or so of the marathon, where they usually run through some great stuff to really draw interest.  But there's always fun stuff throughout.  I would assume that everything is at least wine-searcher lowest price, and occasionally by a good margin.  You'll have to sometimes be ready to pounce before sellout, which can be tough if you don't know exactly what you want, since checking the price/reviews can take too long.  For example, if you want to try German riesling, then snap up any JJ Prum or Schloss Lieser single vineyard stuff as soon as you see it.

10,Sad unlucky story I have to share,"My friend and I have been tracking [LdH Vina Tondonia Rosado 09](https://i.imgur.com/0LwjJui.jpg) for the past month, and noticed 12 available bottles on wine.com for sale. Got them all immediately, and were expecting a shipment today. 

My friend receives a notification that the package has been damaged, and is being returned to the seller. He calls them, and asks if he can inspect the package before they return it. They say ok. He goes to the warehouse, and they tell him the package has actually been returned, but the damage report says out of 12 bottles, all but 1 survived. We were devastated. 

He has a Reisling coming in too, so he thinks hes going to go pick that up. They hand him a box, and it's 6 bottles of the Rose. Now we're completely confused, thinking all 12 were gone, but now have 6 bottles, and have no idea what has happened to the other 6. 

Anyways, just wanted to share this strike of luck with everyone.

 **TL;DR - Saw Vina Tondonia Rose on sale on wine.com ('09), bought all 12 bottles, shipment says package has been damaged and returned.

I'm curious how long folks think I should sit on these before opening them.

4,"Drinking premium wines ""too young""","I like to buy wine, and then drink it. I don't mind having some bottles stored for aging but the primary joy I get from wine is drinking it, which shouldn't be that controversial.

I've recently started to get really interested, and have went from drinking basic cheap stuff to get more informed and are willing to spend more money on great wine.

One aspect, where I need help to make up my mind, is buying premium wine and drink it ""too young"". By ""too young"" I don't mean that it is undrinkable, but rather that it is made to peak after cellaring 5-10 years.

I understand that this is much depending on the specific bottle, style, region etc. and it's hard to give general advice. But let's narrow it down and take Bordeaux as an example, and wines in the $50-$200 range. Like many ""second wines"" from famous producers. I see a lot of these are released at 3-5 years of age. And when I read about them it's often said that they will peak in 5-10 years after release. Is it waste of money to buy them for drinking now? Should I rather spend the money on wine that is made to shine on release?

I know that it's up to preference, if you like young and/or aged wine, and an old bottle is not necessaricly better than a young bottle. So my concern is not really if it is ok to drink them young, rather if it's waste of money to pay for something that might be expensive partly because it is made to age well.

I feel like I might be a bit confused since there seems to be an obsession of talking about when a wine will peak (by people who necesarrily aren't experts). A lot of reviews I find online always have to mention that the wine was ""too young"" or ""I would cellar this for X years"" and so on. I use the word obsession since I often get the feeling that people are focusing too much of what could be in the future and not of the great wine they just had.

So I have been exploring Pinot noir quite a lot recently, taking a particular interest in red Burgundy. I just started a new job and it‚Äôs in the wine industry, and so I‚Äôm getting into wine now more than ever.

Getting to the point, my girlfriend is coming to visit me soon in the USA from Germany. I would really like her to bring me a bottle or two of some good German Pinot Noir, as it is quite difficult to find in my state. In particular, I‚Äôm looking for German Pinot that has a Burgundian style, though if there‚Äôs a really good one that you have in mind which is its own style I am totally open to suggestions. 

My girlfriend is not a big wine drinker, so I‚Äôm trying to research specific wines for her to find for me and bring to the states. She lives in Hamburg, and there are quite a few nice wine stores there (I‚Äôve visited several times). 

My price range goes up to around $50 or so (for each bottle). Since I don‚Äôt get the chance to try German pinots too often here, and since she only has so much space to bring wine bottles, I‚Äôd like to get one or two pretty nice bottles.

So ultimately I‚Äôm looking for recommendations for a good German sp√§tburgunder or two, budget up to $50 or so per bottle, and I really like Burgundian style though I‚Äôm open to anything! I like pinots that aren‚Äôt overwhelmingly jammy or fruit-forward, but more complex and interesting. 

I‚Äôm still pretty new to the wine world and I‚Äôm still developing my palate. I‚Äôm actually focusing more on French wines at the moment, but after trying some Burgundies and with my gf visiting from Germany soon, I want to take this opportunity to try some good German Pinot noir.

7,High-end alternatives to unreachable wines,"Most of us will never taste a DRC Roman√©e-Conti and many never a Chateau Petrus, at least not in a great vintage.

However, there are some (still high-end but not insanely priced) alternatives that almost taste like the real deal and has the same general quality level (or very close to it).

So I wanted to see what alternatives people have to famous blue-chip wines, that mimic the style, the grapes, the alcohol level and the quality levels of the real blue-chip wine, without the same price tag.

---

My own list,

- Chateau Lafleur --&gt; 
El Gran Enemigo Cabernet Franc Single Vineyard Gualtallary

Chateau Lafleur is mainly known for the best Cab Franc man can make. However there is an Argentinian wine, 
El Gran Enemigo Cabernet Franc Single Vineyard Gualtallary, that get pretty close to the quality, the grape mix and even the alcohol level is ""Old World feel"" according to Tim Atkins.

- Chas/Chev/Le/etc-Montrachet --&gt; Chablis Grand Cru

I have found over many tastings that the peak of Chablis Grand Cru from non-cult producers often have at least the quality of minor Montrachets and only rarely can I say I have significantly better wine in a *-Montrachet than in a great CGC. I have had good luck with William Fevre and the Le Clos vineyard and at a fraction of the price.

- Chateau Petrus --&gt; Galatrona

Bit controversial with matching the quality but in the best vintages of Galatrona I can still get the feel of the Petrus like quality of minor/good vintages of the real thing. Like Galatrona 2004 vs Petrus 1999 or so. Mimicing Old World Merlot perfection is hard though, but Galatrona puts in a good effort but I would still only buy in the best 3 vintages they have made and then bulk up instead.

- Controversial: Any mixed-grape Champagne over $500 --&gt; Krug NV

I have been lucky enough to have tasted many champagnes over the years and unless it is a single grape (BdB, BdN) or a Ros√©, I find myself constantly evaluating it against the Krug NV. Not only cause it is widely available-isch but also because it is still non-crazy priced, albeit still expensive. The Krug NV is like the Rolls Royce base car of Champagne but the ""base"" wine is still so amazingly much better than most Prestige vintage Champagnes from other houses and often cheaper.

- Great classic Bx Cabernet, Old World, Left bank --&gt; Catena Nicholas Catena, or, Solengo in good vintages

I love old, classic Bordeaux that does not hammer the point home with 15% alcohol and while a Dominus can be great at times, I struggled to find any non-alcobombs that could mimic what a great Mouton or Las Cases can deliver when great. But the Nicholas Catena flag ship with 80% Cab and just 20% Malbec is awesome for the price and is pretty close to what I want in a great Bx Cab heavy wine. Super Tuscans used to be my go to but the prices spiked and Sassicaia has disappointed me since 2005. Solengo however has some great vintages but there can be far between them and I don't see them as a stable go-to, where as the Catena flagship bottles are pretty much 5050 on great vintages. I bought a lot of 2004 and 2005 of them and don't regret it at all.

8,"This may be a ridiculous question, but I inherited about 50 bottles of red wine, and don't/can't have a wine refrigerator or cellar, so...","...my two options at present are to store them in my apartment which is generally around 68-72 degrees Fahrenheit.

Or, to keep them all in my refrigerator for now at 40 degrees Fahrenheit until I figure out if they can be moved elsewhere.

They are mostly from small wineries in California and a few Southern Hemisphere. The only label I recognize from the grocery store is Acacia but it is not a varietal that seems to be sold in grocery stores. Most are reserve or ""small batch"" (is that a thing?) from places like Sierra Vista, Terre Rouge, Madro√±a, Navarro, Toulouse, etc. The Madro√±a quintet is my favorite.

I don't think they are worth enough to justify an off-site cellar, but many have been cellared (?) for 5-20 years and are all clearly marked by the original owner as to when they would mature, so some have a way to go.

Again, this maybe this is a dumb question but which is better/worse? 70¬∞F or 40¬∞F? I believe 55¬∞F is ideal, but it is right smack-dab in the middle.",wine,1555696643,RayBenCarp,6,2,True,2019-04-19

8,Beaujolais geeks! Advice needed.,"Hi guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I am setting up a tasting for my my wine club, and I hope that you can help me a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Below I have listed the wines in the order that I am planning on serving. Feedback about the serving order is very welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

But my main concern is aeration time.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, most of the bottles a very young and some maybe even too young to be fully unfolded. Personally, I like young wine, and the tasting panel are a bunch of very skilled and highly experienced tasters, so I am not worried about the ability to see the potential in (too) young wines. Besides, Beaujolais is traditionally appreciated while young.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I want to present the wines the best way possible by aerating them.

&amp;#x200B;

Will I benefit from decanting the youngest wines for a very long time (3-4 hours or more)? Or even all of them?

&amp;#x200B;

What are your experiences with aerating Beaujolais? Will they loose fruit or something?

Today‚Äôs Beaujolais and especially from these producers are rather serious and complex wines, so I don‚Äôt think, they will be harmed by aeration.

&amp;#x200B;

I will make shure to have cleared a couple of shelves in my wine fridges to keep the wines (in decanters) at perfect fresh serving temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what are your thoughts on aeration time for quality Beaujolais Crus?

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers and thank you for your help!

Now it makes sense to me that any decrease in the ullage has to be because it's not in the bottle anymore and the primary reason for that is the cork seal is compromised either through age, temp, low humidity and the wine is either evaporated out or some leaks through some temp instability. This can also mean that outside air in turn goes in and can oxidize the wine even further than intended.

I'm guessing this is why direct from the winery the ullage is practically perfect while a bottle from a collector can have a significant lower ullage even if they both look okay on the outside.

I guess this is also why the 2001 Dominus was just as practically fresh to me as a 2012 Dominus I had.

Wouldn't a wax capsule help fight against fluctuation in humidity?

Nose: pronounced with aromas of morels leather and fresh cracked pepper. Undertones of cedar pine forest sour cherries, and rhubarb 

Pallet: light body very light tannins. Pallet starts off with a hit of refreshing spritzy acid, moving into flavours similar to the nose, but with more fruitiness. The cherry notes have ripened, the rhubarb notes are pleasantly mixed with hints of juniper and baking spice. It has a medium finish that bring it all around with a mellow taste brioche and nutmeg. A juicy acid that leaves you wanting more

My sense is what wines fall into this category has changed over the years but particularly interested in those largely available today in releatively recent vintages (say Abreu, Sine Qua Non, Bevan and would love other suggestions). 

Are they worth it? Is the taste worth the price? Even price aside is the taste incredible? 

I‚Äôve managed to get my hands on a couple young Bevan bottles that were less expensive but too early to open. I‚Äôm not actually sure they fall into cult status though fwiw. 

Also, not sure if Cayuse in Washington is considered in the category but have really enjoyed a few of their grenaches and at least come at a relatively lower price point. 

Would love anyone‚Äôs view if it‚Äôs worth reaching for say a Abreu, Sine Qua Non, or others bottles to put away for a while at these high prices or if this whole cult thing is crazy.

I've been researching this one well-renowned restaurant I've been wanting to apply to. I'm a wine newbie so I'm trying to learn their offerings so if they're ever hiring I can have the first clue as to what I'm talking about. Their wine list kinda threw me though. As an example, for their whites by the bottle, they offer two Pinot Grigio, one from California and one Italian; they have one Sancerre, one Riesling, one Pinot Gris and one Albarino; they have four Sauvignon Blanc, three from California and one from New Zealand; there are six Chardonnays, all California. Two are slightly more expensive but for the most part are in the $35-$40 territory. Their reds are very similar. Overall, including dessert wines, this list is nearly a 70-count and it's like 96% California, with a sneeze of Italy and an eyelash each of Germany and France. One Spain, one Argentina. Two Canada. 

I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Even trying to remember how to differentiate between all the California Chardonnay profiles, I just keep asking...Why? Why did you make these choices? Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with them (not that I would know at this point!), just...why?

I'm wondering about some of the challenges that I may face, and the logistics of working full-time + selling my wines when I'm not at the winery. I have a rough idea as to the actual cost of the grapes/bottles/labels, and I do have money set aside for it. 

Long term I'd like to eventually own a small winery &amp; property, and I'd like to have this virtual to help raise money for an actual B&amp;M. Have any of you started your own brand? What obstacles did you face? Any insight would be very helpful!

8,The Wine Tribune ‚Äì Championing the Modestly-Scaled and Affordably-Priced [thewinetribune.wordpress.com/about/,"Why I Am Publishing The Wine Tribune

I‚Äôve launched The Wine Tribune to convey the convictions and perspectives that have only intensified after decades of working in the restaurant and wine industries and as a wine educator and consultant. I publish The Wine Tribune, then:

To uphold and bring to the forefront the reality that wine has always been and remains primarily a modest but beloved accompaniment to the ordinary lives of ordinary people for millennia
To advocate for quality wines that are affordable by people or families with low or modest incomes who consume them with affordable meals or for moderate sociability or relaxation, and:
to provide useful information about such wines to that segment of consumers and, on their behalf, to wine retailers and ‚Äî far less optimistically ‚Äî to restaurateurs and wine bar owners and managers
to delve into and add such support as I am able to the many people and families for whom wine‚Äôs principal function, historically and traditionally, and continuing unto today is as an enhancing, reviving, uplifting part of ordinary meals and ordinary life
To expose the arrogation and skewing of popular journalistic wine discourse on behalf of the small percentage of affluent elites with ample disposable incomes who can comfortably afford to produce and purchase wines that are conspicuously unaffordable in even an occasional sense to the vast majority of wine drinkers. [A 2018 household income of $120,000 ranks approximately in the upper 2% worldwide and upper 23% domestically.  For singles those rankings are top .08% and top 10% respectively.  Benefits, bonuses, and other fringes ‚Äî often overly generous for this class, particularly in the public sector ‚Äî are not included.]
To put into perspective the unrealistic and, to most, utterly irrelevant assumptions and emphases that pervade the major avenues ‚Äî magazines, books, apps, websites, online courses, reference works, and actual classrooms ‚Äî by which people undertake to learn about wine.
I understand that many wine bloggers, local wine columnists, introductory wine educators, and even some published authors do pay attention to affordable, accessible, readily drinkable, and good value wines. Among these:

Many write explicitly for the non-affluent for whom retail wines priced in the mid-to-high teens are an exception and for whom $20- or $30-plus are an extravagance.
Far rarer are those who write for those with household incomes in the lower 70% or even 80% for whom moderate wine consumption is, nonetheless, a regular part of everyday meals, life, and perhaps even culture.
Finally, lest I have not yet succeeded in making my purposes and predispositions clear and transparent, I offer a few assertions and strength-of-association contrasts in the hope of further clarifying my perspective.  Thus:

For personal use, I buy mostly single bottles of a wine according to a mood or in anticipation of a specific kind of meal rather than by their ratings or in lots as a collector/cellarer.
I find nearly all of the very few fully, or nearly, aged age-worthy wines I do buy sitting on the shelves of non-exclusive wine retailers buried among the oft-ignored, rarely-rated, not-really-serious, unfashionable remnants that hardly anyone knew about, bothered to sell, or bought.
I prefer low- to moderately-priced enjoyable wines to more expensive, potentially enjoyable, perhaps even memorable ‚Äî someday ‚Äî wines.
I prefer non-age-worthy wines TO youthfully harsh, possibly age-worthy wines.
[I strongly dislike and avoid palate-rasping tannins and singeing acids, no matter how intensely concentrated, highly-rated, or masked with residual-sugar was the wine that inflicted them on us.  If the wine was truly great, then and someone [else] wasted a lot of money by opening a wine that was far too young and nowhere near ready to drink.  If it was never of a quality to benefit from long ageing, then the winemaker or corporate planners wasted the grapes and the vineyard space that produced them in a likely attempt to concoct an overly-extracted bottling that might, through these efforts, possibly qualify as ‚Äòserious‚Äô enough to justify a $30+ retail price-tag ‚Äî even if the excessive tannins were, in youthful tastings, masked, until swallowed, with young fruit and higher-than-desirable residual sugars. Such wines are often promoted, of necessity, to pair perfectly with contemporary, ‚Äòcreative‚Äô cuisine, which all too often still means little more than ‚Äòincluding fruits, sweet sauces, and/or other sweetening ingredients in tiny portions, preciously and time-consumingly presented to no real end beyond diverting the affluent-jaded and raising the price for all‚Äô.]
I prefer wines that make me eager and financially capable of swallowing a glass [or more] comfortably TO [usually more expensive] vanity wines that are impressive, excessive, showy, and usually too abstractly self-conscious to imagine as part of an affordable meal or as a part of the kind of life I live and rare extravagances for the great mass of those who enjoy wine. 
And lastly, I am no fan of characterless, sweet ‚Äòdry‚Äô, or oak-chip-intensive wines, be they cheap or over-priced;  but I am far closer TO a populist ‚Äòwine-as-one-part-of-an-inexpensive-meal-culture‚Äô traditionalist than I am TO a wine collector, investor, bidder, or high-end-focused connoisseur.
 

AN ADDENDUM and DISCLAIMER:  I am part of that cross-generational clustering that came of age at a time when, happily, the need for fast touch-typing skill was pretty much limited to those in clerical and information/data entry work. The bulk of the population had no need to master speed typing.  I‚Äôve known journalists and writers who typed as I do:  with two fingers and a reflexive, anticipatory sense of the keyboard acquired over time by repetitive mind/muscle memory.

Certainly, few of my peers ever anticipated that the ability to type faster than their minds can think would become a necessary and hugely time-consuming social and work skill among massive chunks of entire generations.  Fewer still would have guessed that entire speed-of-light transmission technologies and ultimately commercial outlets with billions of viewers would come into existence ‚Äî all for the dissemination and preservation of precisely this sort of babble ‚Äî touch-typed or, ever more commonly, typed on tiny virtual keyboards with thumbs!

All this is by way of making clear that in these blogs, I will only occasionally slow an already slow process by typing obvious counter-totalizing disclaimers such as:   ‚Äúmost, but not every‚Äù, ‚Äúthe overwhelming majority of‚Äù, or ‚Äú‚Ä¶but this does not hold for all cases‚Äù, and so on ad nauseam. To me, they are implicit; and obviously so. We all think and speak that way; we all generalize about aggregates; in thinking and in ordinary life, we all make choices and decisions based on probabilistic generalizations ‚Äî well-understood not to be absolutely universal ‚Äî far more frequently than we make them based on detailed knowledge of specific factors and options involved.

5,Wagner Family Terrible,"Why do I never see anyone discussing the horrific winemaking practices of the Wagner family and their negative impact on the industry as a whole? Not that they are the only perpetrators, but they‚Äôre producing god awful, varietally incorrect wines. 

They freeze their grapes to make Pinot Noir that tastes like a $6 Out-of-wack Syrah at $60 retail, don‚Äôt even have an actual physical barrel room (hello chips for wines that are $60+), refused to buy wine in Oregon due to ‚Äúsmoke taint‚Äù leaving farmers high and dry, overproduced for the amount the Caymus Vineyard can produce and got fined, and keep making different bottlings of the same exact wine. There is barely any discernible difference amongst Caymus, Caymus Special Select, Conundrum Red, and the new Bonanza ‚ÄúCab‚Äù. Let alone the 4 different ‚Äúsingle Vineyard‚Äù Belle Glos pinots Joe is producing, or the 3 different Pinots under the Boen label he is producing, or any difference between that and the Mer Soleil Pinot. 

If the US wine industry is to have any hope we need to start with stricter regulations akin to those of serious wine producing countries to crack down on these people making varietally incorrect wines. It‚Äôs a real shame to see people say they love Pinot because Belle Glos is their favorite but if you were to crack a killer burgundy they‚Äôd despise it. 
We need justice for varietals and their actual expressions.

5,"Looking for Suggested Wine Pairing(s) for three separate dishes: Chicken Cauliflower Shepherd Pie / Mushroom Broccoli Stir Fri / Bean Spread on Zucchini Crust ""Pizza""","For an upcoming weekend menu, I'm looking to pair some nice wines for three different meals. If possible, but not necessary, ( we can use a Repour) I‚Äôd like to use a wine for multiple meals.
I'm aware it is hard to find a perfect pairing with several options, especially since we cook relatively non-standard, so feel free to suggest to meal-specific but something that goes for multiple is a plus. No worries if it is sub-optimal, I'm trying to gain experience and see where it fits and what it fits with specifically. The meals are not necessarily eaten across the evenings in the order listed.

The first is a Chicken Cauliflower Shepherd Pie (Recipe: https://www.primaverakitchen.com/mashed-cauliflower-shepherds-pie/ )

The second is a Mushroom Broccoli Stir Fry (Recipe: http://www.berrysweetlife.com/mushroom-broccoli-ginger-stir-fry/ )

The final one is something with a Zucchini Pizza Crust (Recipe: https://www.oatmealwithafork.com/nut-free-and-gluten-free-zucchini-pizza-crust/ ). I think we‚Äôll be topping it with a bean/cheese spread.

What would you recommend? We have a fairly varied cellar (though some notable wines are lacking). The reason I ask is to learn better food/wine from an experienced community!

Multiple suggestions for both red and white, if possible, so we can select a good bottle.

While I am, of course, interested primarily in *your* ideas, I‚Äôd also like to propose a couple of ideas myself.
Considering the ‚Äòamericanness‚Äô of Shepherd Pie and exotic Pizza, I was perhaps thinking of a large US red. 
For the Mushroom Broccoli Stir Fry I‚Äôm unsure. I‚Äôd love to try out one of my ice wines but that is very sweet. It could form a contrast.",wine,1554381949,Kalenden,6,1,True,2019-04-04

12,Basic Wine Cellar Question,"Good afternoon Reditors.

I am having some fun making some kit wine, and I guess we are getting pretty good at it.  We gift much, keep some ourselves, and trade with peers.  Slowly, the personal collection and the volume of ""production inventory"" is going up.  So we have decided to build a basic little cellar to store this stuff.  To be clear, we are talking $10-20 wine, kept for 2-5 years.  Nothing expensive, nothing aging for decades.

In the unfinished part of our basement, we have two 9' concrete walls, completely below grade.  The temperature seems pretty stable.  My thoughts are to frame two interior walls, finish, throw down a floor and some sort of ceiling, and put on an exterior slab door.  End result, a nice simple room with a relative low - and more importantly stable - temperature.  The realistic goal I think is for a slow, seasonable temperature change, instead of whatever we have now.  And all for a couple hundred $$$.

Problem is that I clearly am no expert.  Where am I wrong with this thinking?  Where am I right?

* Do I need to finish the concrete walls?
* What kind of R Value is reasonable?
* Finish floors?  Drop ceiling?",wine,1554405129,ErekoseVonBek,3,6,True,2019-04-04
13,Anyone familiar with or use Oeno Vaults or other professional storage in the Bay Area?,"I've exhausted the capacity of my wine fridge, self-serve offsite storage (12 cases) so now it's starting to pile up in my garage while I figure out what to do with it. Thinking I break out my storage as follows: 

* The wine fridge is good for stuff to drink on a random night and a handful of ""better"" bottles
* Keep the 12 case locker for better stuff that I might want to drink in the next year to have on hand for nicer occasions, bring to a restaurant etc.
* Professional offsite storage for bottles to age 3-5+ years or more along with anything I might want to later sell

I'm slightly cost contentious in that I don't want to spend unnecessarily but willing to spend if needed. I probably acquire around 8-10 cases a year of stuff that I usually sit on for at least a year and mostly more (such is the nature of Napa cab and some Oregon Pinot) and I just don't drink it fast enough. I do like that Oeno Vaults will pick up wine for free from Napa / Sonoma area wineries to avoid shipping costs if I can't make it up in time to pick up wine.
